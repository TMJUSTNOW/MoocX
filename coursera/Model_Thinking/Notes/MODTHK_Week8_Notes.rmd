####*Reading 1: Economic Growth*

[Economic Growth](http://modelthinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/r8growth.pdf)

**A. A Model of Growth**

- the models have three parts: labor, physical capital, output
- output = f(labor, physical capital)
    - if invested, output gets turned into more physical capital
    - "the more output turned into physical capital, the more productive labor will be. However, any output that's invested cannot be consumed."
- why use fixed rules in growth models?
    - models with fixed rules are easier to analyze
    - by varying the fixed rules we'll gain some insights into what a model optimal rule will look like
- linearity tends to become the exception not the rule as models have more moving parts

**B. A Simple Growth Model**

- you probably get decreasing returns to scale as you increase capital
    - i.e. production is described by a concave function
- the basic model has just two equations:
    - $O_{t} = f(K) = AK_{t}^{\alpha}$
    - $K_{t+1} = K_{t} + I_{t} - dK_{t}$
    - $C_{t} = O_{t} - I_{t}$
    - $I_{t} = sO_{t}$
    
**C. The Irony of Growth**

- to continue to have growth, the society needs to build more and more machines
- the added benefit of having more machines decreases (decreasing returns!)
- "so long as savings exceeds depreciation, the capital stock will grow as will output"
- two observations:
    1. the cost of depreciation increases linearly in the number of machines
    2. Output increases at a declining rate in the number of machines
- where does growth stop?
    - at the point where the amount of capital produces a level of output that implies depreciation equal to investment
    - this is the "long run equilibrium"
- solving for LR equilibrium:
    - $20\sqrt{M^{*}} = 0.1M^{*}$
- output increases linearly in the savings rate:
    - a country that saves twice as much will have twice as much output
    - "the number of machines in equilibrium increases with the square of the savings rate and output depends on the square root of the number of machines"
- so what is the irony? "The basic growth model eventually results in a fixed level of output, i.e. no growth
- eventually, you are investing just enough to replace depreciated stock, and the model stalls
- how do we break out? innovation (technological progress)

**D. The Solow Growth Model**

- differences:
    - applies to any amount of labor
    - assumes labor and capital have diminishing returns to scale
    - assumes a technological sophistication parameter (TFP) that changes over time
- The core Solow model output function looks like this:
    - Output: $F(K, L, A(t)) = A(t)L^{\beta}K^{1-\beta} with \beta \in (0,1)$
- the exponents of K and L sum to 1
    - "if both labor and capital are doubled, output will also double"
    - this gives "constant returns to scale"
- a second contribution to growth:
    - *the improved technology creates the posisbility of investing in more capital to produce even more growth*
- remember that equilibrium comes at the point where "the loss due to depreciation equals new investment in capital"
- the innovation multiplier = "Innovation, changes in A(t) increase output both by directly making labor and capital more productive and by creating incentives to invest in more capital
- the model does produce sustained growth, but it will be slowed by replacement time

**E. The Catchup Model of Growth**

- the natural drags on growth cry "nonlinearity" in growth forecasts
    - extrapolation is not going to work here
- "the advantage of backwardness" --> the less capital a country has today, the faster it can grow
    - the country is not yet experiencing severe slowdowns in the marginal productivity of capital

**F. The Limits of Extraction**

- Schumpeter's creative destruction (the replacement of old technologies with new) "lies at the core of growth"
    - "the car replaced the horse, and that change destroyed hundreds of supporting industries at the same time that it created hundreds more"
- extraction will limit growth and innovation will drive it
- prosperous countries have strong central governmetns that promote pluralism:
    1. the strong center creates stability (if you buy stuff you keep it)
    2. pluralism prevents extraction by elites
    3. puralism plus stability promotes innovation and creative destruction

**G. Lags Between Innovation and Growth**

- shocks to technology have two effects:
    - the direct effect increases growth by making the economy more productive with what it has
    - the indirect effect induces further investment (takes longer)

**H. Endogenous Growth**

- endogenous = produced within the model
- Weitzman - "generation and recombination of ideas"
    - diversity in the product market and the labor market result in more ideas that can bump into one another producing ever more growth

**I. Summary**

- the simple models presented here give two explanations for growth:
    - growth from investment
    - growth from innovation
- on model fertility:
    - consider starting with existing models, applying them to other domains, and then taking guidance from where exactly they and their assumptions fail
- 

####*Video 8.1 - Introduction to Growth*

**A. Growth Models**

- there are limits to economic growth (unless you have technological change!)
- gross domestic product (GDP): total market value of all goods and services
- when economists say real, they mean "after accounting for price changes)

####*Video 8.2 - Exponential Growth*

**A. Exponential Growth**

- Rule of 72:
    - divide 72 by growth rate to get an approximation of how many periods doubling will take
    - tends to underestimate for low interest rates, overestimate for high interest rates
- compounding interest matters a LOT over long stretches of time
- the notion of compounding is why we care so much about small differences in economic growth rates

**B. Continuous Compounding**

- looks like this:
    - $Lim_{n} --> (1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt} = e^{rt}$

####*Video 8.3 - Basic Growth Model *

**A. Assumptions**

- the production function is concave in labor and capital
    - diminishing returns to scale
- output is consumption plus investment
- physicaly capital depreciates

**B. The Irony of the Growth Model**

- eventually there's no growth!
- why?
    - depreciation is linear, but output is concave
    - so at some point, the output curve will fall to the slope of the depreciation curve
- we need to include a parameter to account for technological progress (making the people and machines more productive)

####*Video 8.4 - Solow Growth Model*

**A. Total Factor Productivity**

- just add on a scalar at the beginning that is time-varying
- new equation:
    - $O_{t} = A_{t}K_{t}^{\beta}L_{t}^{1-\beta}$
- onward march of technology has two impacts
    - direct: productivity rises, so you get more output of current factor stock
    - indirect: because factors are more productive, higher investment is induced, leading to even more growth!
- The two forces above conspire to form the "innovation multiplier"
- the innovation effect is multiplicative
    - becoming 3x more productive gives us a 9x increase in equilibrium output

**B. Where does technology Growth Come from?**

- endogenous growth:
    - changes in A dependend on output, investment
    - you have some share of investment flowing to R\&D

####*Video 8.5 - Will China Continue to Grow?*

**A. Catch-Up Models of Growth**

- you grow faster if you have a relatively low current stock of capital
    - you haven't moved as far along the curve of diminishing marginal returns
- this process doesn't last forever, though
- for China to keep up its recent growth rates, it will eventually need a massive increase in innovation
    - tight government control of the economy might make this more difficult than it should be
-  "as capital accumulates, growth rates of output fall over time"

####*Video 8.6 - Why Do Some Countries Not Grow?*

**A. Notes**

- "Why Nations Fail" - Acemoglu and RObinson
- growth requires a strong central government to protect capital and investment but that government cannot be controlled by a select few:
    - you need to assure people that their investments will remain their's (property rights)
    - extraction (skimming by government officials) limits growth by lowering investment in innovation and capital
- growth requires creative destruction
    - some jobs (or entire industries) will become unnecessary
    - Joseph Schumpeter

**B. Government Power**

- state-sponsored enterprises have protection from the forces of creative destruction
    - this artificial preservation of relatively inefficient industries will keep productivity down and limit growth

**C. Model Fertility**

- think about this for our own household income:
    - if we don't keep learning stuff (investing in "technology"), eventually growth slows or stops
    - sustained progress depends on innovation
    - the most successful people tend to be those who keep learning

**D. Summary**

- with no innovation, growth tails off
- how do you spur growth?
    - strong central government (property rights)
    - but not too strong (rent-seeking behavior is bad)
- welcome creative destruction
    - more education = decoupling workers from narrowly-defined industries
    - think of it through the "Marketing Myopia" lens

####*Video 8.7 - Piketty's Capital: The Power of a Simple Model*

**A. Capital in the Twenty-First Century**

- "this became a book that not everybody read, but everybody had on their bookshelves"

**B. The Shape of Things to Come**

- increasing returns? decreasing returns?
- Piketty applies and increasing-returns approach to income inequality

**C. The ridiculously simple model**

- here we go:
    - $R > g$
    - where R = rate of return on capital; g = growth in GDP
- growth in wealth = wealth x R
- growth in economy = GDP x g
- if R > g, wealth growth is going to run away
    - this leads to the wealthy (capital holders) taking a larger and larger share of total GDP

**D. Extensions**

- these come from Brad DeLong at UC-Berkeley
- taxes? (wealth is taxed)
    - Piketty recommends a wealth tax
- consumption/donations
- stupidity rate (you might make risky investmetns and blow your money
- so let's try this:
    - $(R-t-c-d-s) > g$ with:
    - R = rate of return on capital
    - t = tax rate
    - c = consumption rate
    - d = donation rate
    - s = stupidity rate
    - g = GDP growth
- final comment:
    - this is a very simple model that still explains a lot about the world
