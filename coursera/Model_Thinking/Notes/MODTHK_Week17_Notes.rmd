####*Reading 1 - The Prisoners' Dilemma in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*

- see [HERE](http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~spage/ONLINECOURSE/PrisonersDilemmaStanford.pdf)

**A. Notes**

- "a group whose members pursue rational self-interest may all end up worse off than a group whose members act contrary to rational self-interest"
- many many formulations of the PD have been put forth

**B. Symmetric 2x2 PD with Ordinal Payoffs**

- "ordinal" = we care about who is better off than someone else, but not necessarily how much better
- defection strictly dominates cooperation
    - "strict domination" --> better no matter what the other player does
- "strong nash equilibrium" = each player could only do worse by defecting

**C. Asymmetry**

- players have same payoff order, but different magnitudes across players
- usually represents a "common knowledge PD", where the dilemma is felt as long as all players assume others act rationally
- however, there may no longer by a strongly dominant strategy

**D. Multiple Moves**

- a game with an equilibrium as the outcome is called an "equilibrium PD"
- one in which the selfish outcome is a pair of dominant moves is a "dominance PD"

**E. Multiple Players**

- "volunteer dilemma" - a group needs a few volunteers, but each member is better off if others volunteer
- in tragedy of the commons games, "the only pareto optimal outcomes are those of minimally effective cooperation"
- limited amount of "free rider" or "surplus cooperation" occurs

**F. Single Person Interpretations**
