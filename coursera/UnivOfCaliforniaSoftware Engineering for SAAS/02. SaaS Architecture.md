# [Software Engineering for SaaS] (https://www.coursera.org/saas/class)

=================================

## Web

- Web is a client server architecture
- It is fundamentally request and reply oriented

### Client-Server Architecture

- Client: ask questions on behalf of users
- Server: wait for and respond to questions, server many clients
- Client-Server is an architectural pattern

### TCP/IP Protocols

#### Internet Protocol

Address identifies a physical network interface with four octets

- Special address `127.0.0.1` is the "this computer" named `localhost`

#### Transmission Control Protocol

- **IP**
    - No guarantee, best effor service that delivers packets from one IP to another
- **TCP**
    - Make IP reliable by detecting 'dropped' packets, data arriving out of order, transmission errors, slow networks
    - Ports allow multiple TCP apps on same computer

### DNS

A server that maps names to IP addresses (SaaS)

### HTTP

An ASCII based request/reply protocol for transferring information on the web.

- HTTP requests include
    - Request method : GET, POST, etc
    - Uniform Resource Identifier
    - Headers
- HTTP response include
    - Protocol version and status code
    - Response headers
    - Response body

### Quiz

**Assuming '>' means 'relies on', which statement is not correct?**

- (a) DNS > IP
- (b) HTTP > TCP > IP
- (c) TCP > DNS
- (d) All of the above

**Answer:** (c)

### Cookies

HTTP is stateless

**A golden rule:** Don't trust the client  - cookie must be tamper-evident

### Quiz

**A ____ can create and modify cookies; the ____ is responsible for including the correct cookie with each request**

- (a) Browser, SaaS app
- (b) SaaS app, Browser
- (c) HTTP request, Browser
- (d) SaaS app, HTTP response

**Answer:** (b)


## HTML and CSS

### CSS

Visual appearance of page describe in a separate document

- Accessibility
- Branding/targeting
- Separate designers & developers concern

HTML `id` & `class` attributes help us create CSS markups

- `id` must always be unique

- `hi`
- `.pageFrame`
- `#pageFrame`
- `div.pageFrame`
- `span#pageFrame`
- `div .pageFrame`

### Quiz

**Which CSS selector will select only the word `bar` for styling?**

```html
<p class="a"> foo, 
    <span class="a">bar</span>
</p>
```

- (a) span, a
- (b) p .a
- (c) .a span
- (d) all of the above

**Answer:** (d)

## 3-Tier Shared-Nothing Architecture and Scaling

### Dynamic content generation

How do you:

- 'map' URI to correct program and function
- pass arguments
- invoke program on server
- handle persistent storage
- handle cookies
- handle errors
- package output back to user

**Frameworks** support these common tasks

### Sharding Vs Replication

#### Partition data across

- Scales great
- Bad when operations touch > 1 table
- Example use: user profile

#### Replicate data

- Multi-table queries fast
- Hard to scale: writes must propagate to all copies
- Example use: Facebook wall posts


### Quiz

**Match the terms (a) presentation tier (b) logic tier (c) persistence tier**

- (a) Apache, Rack+Rails, Relational Database
- (b) Firefox, Apache, PostgreSQL
- (c) Microsoft Internet Information Server, Rack+Rails, Apache
- (d) Firefox, Microsoft Internet Information Server, MySQL

**Answer:** (a)

### Model View Controller (MVC)

**Goal:** To separate organizational of data from UI and presentation by introducing *controller* 

- Mediates user actions requesting access to data
- Presents data for rendering by the bew

Web apps may seem 'obviously' MVC by design, but other alternatives are possible

### Quiz

**Which statement is not true about the MVC architectural pattern?**

- (a) In SaaS apps, on the web, controller actions and view contents are transmitted using HTTP
- (b) All MVC apps have both a 'client' part and a 'cloud' part
- (c) MVC is just one of several possible ways to structure a SaaS app
- (d) P2P apps can be structured as MVC

**Answer:** (b)

## Models, Databases and Active Record

### In-Memory vs In-Storage objects

- How to represent persisted object in storage
    - Ex: Movies and Reviews
- Basic operations on object: CRUD
- ActiveRecord: every model knows how to CRUD itself, using common mechanisms

### Rails Models Store Data in RDB

- Each type of model gets its own database table
    - All rows in table have identical structure
    - 1 row in table
    - Each column stores value of an attribute of the model
    - Each row has unique value or *primary key*

### DataMapper

Data Mapper associates separate mapper with each model

- Idea: keep mapping independent of particular data structure used
- Cons: can't exploit RDNMS features to simplify complex queries and relationships
- Used by Google AppEngine


## Controllers, Routes and RESTfulness

### Controllers

- Limited to the app server

### Routes

- In MVC each interaction the user can do interaction handeled by a controller action
- A route maps `<HTTP method, URI>` to controller action


|Route   | Action |
|:-------|-------:|
|   GET  /movies/3         |    Show info about movie whose ID=3                   |
|   POST /movies           |   Create new movie from atached form data                    |
|   PUT  /movies/5         |  Update movie id 5 from attached form data                     |
|   DELETE  /movies/5    |   Delete movie whose ID=5                    |


**Example:**

`GET /movies/3/edit HTTP/...`

- Matches route
    - `GET /movies/:id/edit {:action => 'edit', :controller => 'movies', ...}`
- Parse wildcard parameters `params[:id] = '3'`
- Dispatch to `edit` method in `movies_controller.rb`
- To include a URI in generated view that will submit the form to the update controller action with `params[:id] == 3`
- Call helper `update_movie_path(3)`


### REST

**Idea**
Self-contained requests specify what resouce to operate on and what to do

A service whose operations are like this is a RESTful service. Ideally, RESTful URLIs name the operations


## Template Views and Haml

### Template View Pattern

View consists of markup with selected interpolation to happen at runtime

```haml
%h1.pagename All Movies
    %table#movies
        %thead
            %tr
                %th Movie Title
                %th Release Date
                %th More Info
        %tbody
            - @movies.each do |movie|
                %tr
                    %td= movie.title
                    %td= movie.release_date
                    %rd= link_to "More on #{movie.title}", | 
                       movie_path(movie) |
- link_to `Add new movie'. new_movie_oath
```

### Don't put code in your views

- Syntactically, you can put any code in views
- But MVC advocates this views and controllers

### "Rails doesnt scale" 

- Scalability is an architectural concerm not confined to languange and framework
- The stateless tiers of 3-tier arch do scale
- Traditional relational databases dont scale
- Various solutions combining relational and non relational storage scale much better
- Intelligent use of caching can greately improve the constant factors

### Quiz

**What happens if you embed code in your Rails view that directly accesses the model?**

- (a) It will work, but it's bad and violates the MVC guidelines
- (b) It will work when developing agains a 'toy' database but not in production
- (c) It wont work, because views cant communicate directly with models
- (d) Behaviour varies depending on the app

**Answer:** (a)
