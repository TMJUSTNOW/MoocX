<center> <h3>---------------------------------------</h3> </center>

####*Video 1.1 Introduction*

**A. What the Class is About **

- this is about exploratory (pre-inference) analysis

####*Video 1.2 Principles of ANalytic Graphics*

**A. General Rules**

1. Show comparisons
    - evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another, competing hypothesis
2. Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
    - how is the system operating? How does the world work?
    - what is your "causal framework"?
3. Show multivariate data
    - show as much on a single plot as you can
    - "the real world is multivariate"
    - need to "escape flatland"
4. Integration of evidence
    - data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
    - don't let the tool (graphic device) drive the analysis
5. Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
    - a data graphic shoud tell a cmplete story that is credible
    - keep the code that made the plot
6. Content is king
    - if your story isn't interesting, graphs won't magically make it more interesting
    - start with the data and the story, then choose the appropriate plots
    
####*Video 1.3 Exploratory Graphs (pt 1)*

**A. What are Exploratory Graphs?**

- pretty much made for yourself
- why use them?
    - find patterns, understand properties, suggest modeling strategies
    - debug analysis
- made quickly, a large number are made
- the goal here is just for personal understanding of the data
- axes/legends cleaned up later
- color/size are primarily used for information
- you can use the *breaks* argument in hist() to change how many bars there are
- use ```abline()``` to add vertical or horizontal lines to the plot

####*Video 1.4 Exploratory Graphs (pt 2)*

**A. 2 Dimensionsal Summaries of Data**

- scatterplots
- multiple/overlayed plots (lattice/ggplot2)
- spinning plots (3D)

**B. Some programming tips**

- to not have to always use the dollar sign, you can use ```with()``, for example:
    - ```with(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25, col = region))```
- latitude runs from north to south

####*Video 1.5 Plotting Systems in R*

**A. Base Plotting System**

- from original version of R
- set up a blank canvas, and add stuff one by one
- plot generation, then annotation plots
- once the plot has started, you can't go back (need to plan in advance)
- it's tough to translate a new plto to another person
- plot is just a series of R commands (you have lots of control, but you have to control it)

**B. The Lattice System**

- plots are a single function call, stored in a "Trellis" object
- really useful for conditiong types of plots: looking at how y changes with x across levels of z
- margins/spacing are set automatically because everything happens at once
- lots of plots on a page all at once
- panel functions and subscripts (annotation) are difficult
- annotating individual panels is tough

**C. The ggplot2 System**

- automatically deals with spacings, text, titles but also lets you annotate
- pretty similar to lattice but easier/more intuitive
    - useful for conditioning
- default makes a bunch of choices for you, but you can always customize them
- transition from lattice to ggplto 2 fairly easy

####*Video 1.6 Base Plotting System (pt 1)*

**A. Plotting System**

- all of this system is in basic R already
- a bunch of graphics devices included

**B. The Process of Making a Plot**

- will you make this on the screen or send to a file?
- do you want to dynamically resize the graphic?
- you can't really mix base, lattice, and ggplot2

**C. Base Graphics**

- initialize the plot, then annotate it
- calling the initializing functions will launch a graphics device
- definitely worth examining the parameter defaults in ```?par```
- examples of plots --> ```plot()```, ```hist()```, ```boxplot()```

**D. Key Graphic Parameters**

1. pch - the plotting symbol
2. lty - the line type
3. lwd - the line width
4. col - the plotting color, sepecified as number, string, or hex code
    - note that the colors() function gives you a vector of colors by name
    - colors() is a string list of color names...could randomly pick elements from it
5. xlab/ylab - axis label strings

- Stuff set in the par() function:

1. las - the orientation of the axis labels on the plot
2. bg - the background color
3. mar - the margin size
4. oma - the outer margin size (default is 0 for all sides)
5. mfrow - number of plots per row, columnn (plots filled row-wise)
6. mfcol - number of plots per row, column (plots filled column-wise)

- call par("arg") for current/default value of the graphics parameters

####*Video 1.7 Base Plotting System (pt 2)*

**A. Base Plotting Functions**

- plot - make a scatterplot
- ```lines()``` - add lines to a plot
- ```points()``` - add points to a plot
- ```text()``` - add labels inside the plot
- ```mtext()``` - put text in the margins
- ```axis()``` - specify axis ticks
- ```title()``` - add title to the plot (if you didn't do it in main=)
- ```legend()``` - add a legend
- ```abline()``` - add a regression line to a plot

**B. Annotation Examples**

- you can set the plot as type="n" to set up but not write anything
    - then go through one at a time for different colors (plot subsets)
- adding a regression line to a plot:
    - store regression in an object
    - call ```abline(thatobject, lwd=2)```

**C. Multiple Base Plots**

- change panel size with par(mfrow)
- then just keep adding plots
- for a "master title" on a panel, use ```mtext("title", outer = TRUE)```

**D. Summary**

- in base, you create a plot and then annotate
- you're building up a plot function by function (so it's basically just a collection of code)
- this is really flexible, but also can get tedious
    - good for publication-quality plots

####*Video 1.8 Base Plotting Demonstration*

**A. Some Examples**

- dafult in base plot is to use object name as axis label
- margins (numbered counterclockwise):
    - bottom: 1
    - left : 2
    - top : 3
    - right : 4
- legend:
    - "bottomright, bottomleft, topright, topleft"
- when you use text(), the coordinates are data coordinates (not graphical params like inches or pixels
- for different colors: set up the plot, then do one call at a time to plot different subsets
    - use the ```points()``` function to add points one a time (with different colors)
    
####*Video 1.9 Graphics Devices in R (pt. 1)*

**A. What is a Graphics Device?**

- some place you can make a plot appear
    - a window on your computer (screen device)
    - PDF file
    - PNG/JPEG file
    - scalable vector graphics (SVG) file (file device)
- you can find a full list of devices on ```?Devices```, or get other types of devices from CRAN packages
- usually screen device is the best place to send a plot
- a file device is better for plots that might be printer out or incorporated into a document

**B. How Does a Plot Get Created?**

1. Basic
    - call a plotting functions
    - plot appears on the screen
    - annotate it
2. Use a File Device
    - explicitly launch a graphics device
    - call a plotting function to make a plot
    - annotate plot if necessary
    - explicitly close the device with ```dev.off()``` (THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT)
    
####*Video 1.10 Graphics Devices in R (pt 2)*

**A. Graphics File Devices**

1. vector formats:
    - pdf: useful for line-type graphics, resize well, usually portable, not graet for plots with lots of points
    - SVG: web-based plots. supports animation and interactivity, useful for web-based plots
    - Windowns metafile (win.metafile)
2. bitmap formats:
    - png: bitmapped format, good for line drawings or images with solid colors. Uses lossless compression. Good for many, many points. Does not resize well
    - jpeg: good for photographs or natural scenes (gradient colors), lossy compression, good for lots of points
    - tiff: TIFF format, supports lossless compression
    - NOTE: do not resize bitmpas. They won't look very good
    - bmp: a native Windows bitmapped format (used for stuff like icons)
    
**B. Multiple Oopen Graphics Devices*

- launch devices explicitly (call the screen device many times)
- ```dev.cur()``` returns which graphics device is currently active. Integer starting at 2
    - then use ```dev.set()``` to switch to other open devices (choose wich is active)

**C. Copying Plots**

- for taking something from the screen and putting it in a file
- use ```dev.copy``` from one device to  another
- ```dev.copy2pdf``` specifically copies a plot to a PDF file
- copying is inexact, so plot in the new device might look different from what's on your screen

**D. Summary**

- plots created on a graphics device
- default graphics device is almost always the screen device
    - windows screen device called with ```windows()```
    - call this multiple times to open multiple screen devices
- file devices useful for creating plots that can be included in other documents or sent to other people
- for file devices, there are vector and bitmap formats:
    - vector formats are good for line drawings and plots with solid colors using a modest number of points
    - bitmap formats are good for plots with a large number of points, natural scenes or web-based plots
