####*Video 3.1 - The Importance of Probability*

**A. Notes**

- probability impacts difficulty in games
- probability helps you to put events into the proper context

####*Video 3.2 - Basics of Probability*

**A. Notes**

-  probability is an analysis of random phenomena
- "uniformly distributed" = all outcomes have the same probability

**B. Simulations**

- we can use computers to simulate trials, random events
- we can build tests in Python to see if the random numbers returned in Python are reasonable
- random process should asymptotically approach the theoretical properties of a distribution

####*Video 3.3 - Expected Value*

**A. Notes**

- "expected value" is an asymptotic property
- you can only multiply the probabilities of independent events
- expected value will always be just value of outcomes times their probabilities
- there is great value in comparing expected to observed events

####*Video 3.4 - Monte Carlo Methods*

**A. Notes**

- we do Monte Carlo simulations when finding an analytical result is impossible or too difficult/costly
- Monte carlo methods are used for:
    - optimization
    - probability distributions
    - numerical integration

**B. How They Work**

- just iterate a bagillion times and see what happens
- make sure you use enough trials to get a good result
- make sure the way you do this accurately simulates the phenomenon you're interested in

####*Video 3.5 - Objects and References*

**A. Notes**

- in Python, everthing is an object
- an object is a piece of memory that holds data
    - also has a type, which implies methods
    - object = data + behaviors
- variables = references to objects
    - like nametags
- objects can have multiple references
    - if you do ```x = [3,4,5]``` and ```y=x``` will give you two references to the same object
- even the elements in your list are actually references to other locations in memory
- when you pass a variable into a a function, you are actually passsing a reference
    - you need to explicitly create copies if you want to work with copies
- the data live in objects
    - you need references to access them
    - if you enter the object through any one reference, the object will change and if you call another reference to the same thing, you will get the new object

####*Video 3.6 - Tic-Tac-Toe - Monte Carlo*

**A. Notes**

- if both players know what they're doing, noone wins
- the goal is to create a machine player that won't lose
- we're going to create a machine player that plays a bunch of games and decides the best move
- [tic-tac-toe Monte carlo](https://class.coursera.org/principlescomputing1-004/wiki/tictactoemc)

**B. Implementing the Game**

- scoring game boards
    - maybe add 2 for the winning squares, subtract 1 for losing squares
- no useful information in draws
- basically, the idea is just to mark all the winning squares
- the template has a lot of missing stuff this time
    - "pushing you a little outside your comfort zone"
- Monte Carlo methods can be used for lots and lots of applications outside of game
