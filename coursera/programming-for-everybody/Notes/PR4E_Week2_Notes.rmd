####*Video 2.1 Expressions*

**A. Constants**

- fixed values such as numbers, letters, strings that do not change

**B. Variables**

- a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the variable name
- you can change this stuff later on

**C. Variable Name Rules**

- should start with a letter
- must consist of letters and numbers and underscroes
- case sensitive names

**D. Math**

- if you throw in a floating point number anywhere, the math from that point on in the expression is done in floating point

####*Video 2.2 - Type*

**A. What does "Type" Mean?**

- Python changes the meaning of operators (like the "+") based on the types of the operands

**B. TraceBack Errors**

- you try to combine variables of different types, Python is not going to be happy with you
- a TraceBack error means you did something wrong
- you can use the ```type()``` function to see the types of objects
- it will do some implicit conversions (like when you combine an integer and floating operand)
- you can also comvert between strings and numbers

**C. User Input**

- calling ```raw_input()``` prompts the user to enter something
- this will return a string (no matter what is typed in)
- useful programs:
    - take some inputs
    - do stuff to it
    - produce some outputs

**D. COmmenting in Python**

- use the "#" character to comment
- using commenting is a good way to do debugging

**E. Choosing variable Names**

- you should choose mnemonic names to make your programs more readable
- mnemonic = "memory aid"
- well-named variables often "sound" so good that they must be keywords
    - always write code as if the person you're giving it to is a psychopath who knows your address

####*Video 2.3 - Piazza*

**A. What it Is**

- Pooja Sankar - computer science grad from IIT
- an online conversation platform
    - she picked up Ruby on Rails and HTML/CSS in 10 days
- only $50-$100 for server space at first
- you don't always want growth  right away
    - she opted to stay small to isolate the users you want and keep working on development
    - if you grow too fast, it might crash and burn
- she likes to walk in isolation to clear her mind
