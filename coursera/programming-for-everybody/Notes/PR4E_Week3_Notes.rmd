####*Video 3.1 - Conditional Statements*

**A. Notes**

- we'll start seeing program composition now
- conditional steps (with if statements) may or may not be executed
- conditional operators in Python:
    - ```<,<=,>,>=``` what you might expect
    - ```==``` to test equality
    - ```!=``` to test "not equals"
- remember that ```=``` (single equal) is used for assignment
    - double equal is the "question" form

**B. One-Way Decisions**

- this would just be "if this is true" DO STUFF
- de-indenting after the if tells Python what to execute if the condition evaluates to true

**C. Indentation**

- Python is one of the few languages that treats indentation as syntactically important
- maintain indent to indicate the scope of the Python block
- reduce indent back to the level of the if statement or for statement to indicate the end of the block
- blank lines, comment lines are ignored

**D. Warning: Turn Off Tabs**

- most text editors can turn tabs into spaces - make sure to enable this feature
- Python cares a lot about how far line is indented. IF you mix tabs and spaces, you may get indentation errors even if everything looks fine.
- indentation has meaning in Python (begin/end blocks)

####*Video 3.2 - Examples of Conditional Statements*

**A. Nested Loops (Decisions)**

- multiple if statements inside each other
- you might be faced with two-way decisions:
    - i.e. do one thing for True and something different for False
- you can extend blocks with ```elif``` ("else if") and eventually end with an ```else```
- be careful to think through all of your elif and else conditions
    - you could walk yourself into a logical corner and end up writing a bunch of code that will never get executed!

####*Video 3.3 - Try and Except*

**A. Handling Errors**

- surround a dangerous section of code with try and except
- if the code in the ```try``` works, the ```except``` is skipped
    - otherwise, if ```try``` errors out, run the ```except``` block
- the stuff inside ```try``` but before the error-causing line will still run before skipping to the ```except``` block...so think carefully about how you order things
- you can use try/except to write your own, informative error messages
- short circuit evaluations using ```break```

####*Video 3.4 - Massimo Banzi on The Arduino*

**A. The Arduino**

- the goal was to make electronics approachable for people
- Arduino is a microcontroller that runs Processing (language for artists/designers)
    - the idea was to help artists prototype
- the hardware was released as open-source
- "the blinking LED is the 'Hello World!' of physical computing"
- people should be empowered to be creative with digital technology
    - there is a trend where people just buy devices and use them but they aren't building anything
- the goal of Arduino is to convince students that the world around is designable, manageable, malleable, affectable
- if you don't participate, "someone else will design your world"
