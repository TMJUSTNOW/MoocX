- Investment advice:
    - Don't speculate in stocks or real estate

####*Video 1.3 - real Rates of Return*

**A. Notes**

- Individuals need to save and earn for retirement
- If you don't earn more than the rate of inflation, you suffer a loss in purchasing power
- nominal rate - inflation rate= real return
- To generate real returns, you need to take more risks (like w/ common stocks)
    - Ibbotson SBBI
- T-bills & bonds do not offer much return above inflation
    - historically, T-bills have outperformed inflation by 10 bps
    - Gov. Intermediate bonds offer 210 bps
- Directly investing in common stock, ETFs, Mutual funds offer relatively inexpensive, but higher-risk, assets

####*Video 1.4 - Long-Run Returns & Risks*

**A. Notes**

- Common stocks are riskier because they don't offer a fixed return
- US stock market since 1926
- returns for a calendar year as high as 54% (1933), low as -43% (1931) & -37% (2008)
- Best measure of return=compound geometric mean
- Stocks have significantly outperformed bonds and treasury bills
- S&P returns returned 4.4% risk premium
    - Return on stocks - Gov. bonds
    - "small firm effect" these stocks earn 11.7% compound mean
    - very high volatility
- positive risk-return relationship
    - higher risk higher returns
- high monthly volatility of stocks
- Bonds are not very volatile (but they've become more volatile over the last 20 years)
- Why stocks?
    - stocks= own a part of a company. More potential to create significant economic value
    - bonds= holders are just creditors; less risk, lower returns
