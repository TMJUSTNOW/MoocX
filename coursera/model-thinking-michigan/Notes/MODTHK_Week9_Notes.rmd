####*Reading 1: Diversity and Problem Solving*

[Diversity and Problem Solving](http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~spage/ONLINECOURSE/R9ProblemSolving.pdf)

**A. Notes**

- "talent hits a target that no one else can hit; genius hits a target no one else can see" - Arthur Schopenhauer
- decision = f(heuristics, prespectives, interpretations, predictive models)
- diversity creates benefits. Period.

**B. Problem Solving**

- "in a well-constructed agent-based model, the interactions among the agents and between the agents and the environment tell us something about the real world: how prices emerge in a market or even how riots start"
    - emergent behavior is the deisred result
- a key tradeoff in problem solving:
    - exploitation (copying and learning from others) vs exploration (searching for new representations and search algorithms)
- when searching over a 2D solution space...
    - ...think of each square of the matrix as an elevation
- "the best problem-solvers tend to be similar; therefore, a collection of the best problem solvers performs little better than any one of them individually"
    - a collection of random, but intelligent, problem slvers tends to be diverse
    - "diversity trumps ability"
- "although computational experiments persuade most physicists, mathemeticians, and biologists, they are not the coin of the realm for economists"

**C. Individual Diversity and Collective Problem Solving**

- "diversity" might, for example, mean different heuristics or perspectives
- perspective = one to one mapping of reality into internal language
- people tend to have different local optima...so a group is less likely to get stuck
    - "different perspectives create different landscapes, and different landscapes have different peaks"
- local optima are defined relative to a perspective and the set of heuristics applied to that perspective
    - "the more tools in our kits, the fewer places we get stuck"
    
**D. Interpreting Problem Solvers by Their Peaks**

- better problem solvers tend to have better and fewer local optima
    - they could use perspectives that create less rugged landscapes (fewer local optima)
    - or they could possess more heuristics allowing them to move off from peaks in their landscapes
- "basin of attraction" = its size equals the probability that the problem solver gets stuck at that peak
    - bigger basins of attraction tend to pull decisionmakers in if they even get close
- this notion of optima as "peaks" is where we get the "hill-climbing" algorithm from
- better problem solvers tend to have bigger basins of attraction for their better optima
- internal diversity (diverse perspectives and diverse heuristics) need not create external diversity (movements in the space of solutions)
    - diverse people may solve problems differently
    - diverse perspectives and diverse heuristics can cancel each other out
    
**E. Diversity Trumps Ability**

- "a homogeneous collection may just as well contain a single person"
- "the possibility of improvement (on local optima) explains why diversity trumps homogeneity"
- intersection --> "the only local optima for a group of people are those that are local optima for everyone in the group"
- "...diversity creates iterative improvements. And these improvement continue until the collection finds a solution that lies in the intersection of the local optima for all the problem solvers"
- conditions under which diversity trumps ability:
    1. The problem is difficult (no individual problem solver always locates the global optimum)
    2. The local optima of every problem solver can be written down in a list (in other words, all problem solvers are smart)
    3. Any solution other than the global optimum is not a local optimum for some nonzero percentage of problem solvers.
    4. Good-sized collection draw from lots of potential problem solvers
- given the four fonditions above, a randomly selected collection of problem solvers outperforms a collection of the best indvidual problem solvers
    - diversity doesn't always trump ability, just sometimes
- applications:
    - "How do we apply this in the real world? Simple. When picking two hundred employees from a pool of thousands, provided the people are all smart, we should keep the theorem in mind and not necessarily rank people by some crude ability score and pick the best. We should seek out difference. When picking four students from a class of sixty to work as a team to compete in a science competition, keep the theorem in mind as well, but pick the best four-unless they're demonstrably similar in skills.
    
**F. Darwin's Brass Tacks**

- think about a bunch of people dumping out their tools
    - you might think that the high-IQ group (which has more tools) would have more unique tools
    - that is wrong...there is some self-selection into the group of high IQ people
    - the set with lower individual performers might have more unique tools
- "a group of the best might approach the problem the same way"
- Darwin: "selection reduces diversity"
- "even though we might think that we are selecting on something called ability, ability depends on tools. By selecting those who perform better, we get people with more tools. That helps collective performance. But we also get people who are less diverse, and that hurts collective performance. Thaty's why groups of the best need not be the best groups"
    
####*Video 9.1 - Problem Solving and Innovation*

**A. Notes**

- perspectives - forming your view of peaks and valleys
- heuristics - how you interpret the world. Think hill climbing, random search
- teams have a more diverse set of perspectives and heuristics
- recombination = taking someone else's solution to a problem and applying it to your problem
- diversity leads to innovation (remember that's the key to economic growth!)

####*Video 9.2 - Perspectives and Innovation* 

**A. Introduction**

- perspective is how you represent problems
    - a representation of the set of all possible solutions
- types of map coordinates:
    - Cartesian = x,y pair
    - polar = radius (distance from origin) and theta (angle)
- perspectives are a way of organizing our thinking

**B. Landscapes**

- perspectives shape the landscape of potential outcomes
    - this landscape has multiple local optima
- a good perspective should have fwe, high-value local optima
- "Mt. Fuji landscape" - single peak (equal to the global optima)
    - basically just a quadratic relationship

**C. Sum to Fifteen**

- cards numbered 1-9 face up on table
- players alternate selecting cards
- win if you hold exactly three cards that add up to 15
- a different perspective (Magic Square) turns this game into tic-tac-toe
    - make the problem easier!
- savant existence theorem: for any problem there exsts a perspective that creates a Mt. Fuji landscape (in fact many do)
- with N alternatives, there are N! ways to create one dimensional landscapes
    - there are a lot of bad perspectives

####*Video 9.3 - Heuristics*

**A. Notes**

- heuristics = how you go about finding solutiosn to problems once you've represented them in your perspective
    - finding local optima
- you need to:
    - find them
    - know that you're on them
- an example: "do the opposite"
- another: "big rocks first"
    - imagine that you have a bucket and bunch of rocks
    - put the big ones in first, and the little one will fill in the gaps
    - i.e. if you want to be successful, deal with important things first

**B. No Free Lunch Theorem**

- all algorithms that search the same number of points with the goal of locating the meximum value of a function defined on a finite set perform exactly the same when averaged over all possible functions
    - i.e. no single heuristic is better than any other across all problems
- unless you know something about the problem being solved, no algorithm or heuristic performs better than any other
    - domain expertise matters!

**C. Diverse Heuristics**

- diverse heuristics = many different ways of finding solutions on the same landscape
    - less likely to get "stuck" on a poor local optimum

####*Video 9.4 - Teams and Problem Solving*

**A. Combining Heuristics and Perspectives**

- better problem solvers have fewer and more valuable local optima
- the team's local optima is the set of the intersection of local optima of the individual team members
    - we want teams of people with different local optima
- the implication is that we want people with diverse perspectives and diverse heuristics
- we can communicate/collaborate through the solution produced
    - this is consistent with Hidalgo's notion of products as crystals of imagination
- solving big problems involves combining solutions to a bunch of sub-problems

####*Video 9.5 - Recombination*

**A. Combining Many Solutions**

- how many ways to pick three objects from ten?
    - (10x9x8)/(3x2x1)
- there is a huge explosion in the space of potential combinations
- each new idea can be combined with every other idea
    - recombinant growth - Martin Weitzman
- big pieces of machinery consist of "many smaller solutions to smaller problems"

**B. Exaptation**

- you come up with some solution for one problem, and that solution gets applied to other problems
- even failed solutions for one problem may work well for other problems
- sustained growth requires communication of ideas
    - rise of modern universities, printing press made it much easier to share ideas, and this contributed to the "kickstart" in economic growth

**C. Summary**

- perspective: a landscape of solutions to a problem
- heuristics: ways of searching for solutions
