####*Reading 1 - Giant Sucking Sound: Lyapunov Functions*

- see [HERE](http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~spage/ONLINECOURSE/R11Lyapunov.pdf)

**A. Notes**

- "once we know how the system functions, we can often predict whether or not it will equilibriate"
- "some systems don't go to equilibrium and can't fit into the model...this doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to wedge them in....by seeing what edges we have to saw off the round peg, we learn what features of those system cause them not to equilibriate"

**B. The Lyapunov Functions**

- assumptions:
    1. There exists some positive, finite resource (quantity of interest)
    2. There exists a process that occurs in discrete time steps and if this process is not in equilibrium, the resource decreases
    3. The amount of decrease has a non-zero minimum
- any model satisfying these assumptions tends to an equilibrium
- a Lyapunov funciton converges to a fixed point in which L(R~t~) = R~t~
- "zeno's paradox" --> half of half of half of half

**C. A Return to the Voter Model**

- equilibrium = no further changes
- using the Lyaponov Model, we can explain why the voter model converges

**D. A Pure Exchange Economy**

- in a market:
    - happiness is bounded (assumption 1)
    - trade increases happiness (assumption 2)
    - costs of trading imply happiness increases by a fixed amount (assumption 3)
- no guarantee of efficiency....the system will meet an equilibrium but maybe not the global one

**E. Lack of Equilibria**

- it's not enough to just say "I can't find a Lyapunov function...this thing never gets to equilibrium"

**F. Externalities and Equilibria**

- externalities don't necessarily prevent identification of a Lyapunov function
    - as long as the changes in the objective function outweigh any countervailing force from the externalities, the system can eventually settle into equilibrium
    
####*Video 11.1 - Lyapunov Functions*

**A. Notes**

- functions that map models to outcomes
- a Lyapunov function helps us understand whether some systems go to equilibrium or not

**B. How Does it Work?**

- physics:
    - if the system moves, it falls
    - there is a minimum
- economists:
    - people trade, happiness goes up (otherwise they wouldn't trade)
    - Noone can go above maximum happiness
    - if the process has to stop, there must be an equilibrium
- remember Zeno's paradox:
    - "keep going halfway, you'll never get there"
    - Lyapunov function usually has something like "if you move, it's by at least k"
- Lyapunov also helps you identify how fast you'll reach equilibrium
- the hard part:
    - constructing the Lyapnuov function itself
- Lyapunov functions are DIFFERENT from markov functions

####*Video 11.2 - The Organization of Cities*

**A. Notes**

- cities seem to self-organize
    - not a lot of places very vacant or very crowded

**B. City Organization Example**

- behavior: people switch two locations to avoid crowds
- think about reducing "number of people you meet"
- a Lyapunov rule: switch so I meet less people

**C. COnditions for Lyapunov**

- A1: Has a minimum value
- System can only move in one direction and by at least some amount k
- even though there is a lot of complexity in cities, the Lyapunov function of "minimize meetings" is an undercurrent pulling down line lengths, crowdedness
- a great example of the power of simple models
- again....the hardest part is identifying the function

####*Video 11.3 - Exchange Economies and Externalities*

**A. Notes**

- In a clear non-equilibrium situation, Lyapunov can help you identify what is preventing equilibrium outcomes
- can't put a Lyapunov on something with externalities (probably)
- mergers, political alliances...create externalities, cause churning
- only externalities in the opposite direction of the system prevent equilibrium
    - they cause "netting out' and "churning'
- with negative externalities, we might not be able to predict whether the system reaches equilibrium, complex outcome

####*Video 11.4 - Time to Convergence and Optimality*

**A. Notes**

- maximum number of periods to equilibrium = (max state - current state)/K
- we can only get a bound on the number of periods
- bigger K implies faster convergence
- remember the "rugged landscape"...
    - Lyapunov function will just get you to some equilibrium, not necessarily the global optimum
- initial endowments matter...could trap you at a suboptimal local optimum

####*Video 11.5 - Lyapunov: Fun and Deep

**A. Notes**

- externalities keep things churning
- some cases, you just cannot show that a system does/does not converge
- "we can't always know a system stops"
- [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)

####*Video 11.6 - Lyapunov or Markov*

**A. Notes**

- 4 outcomes: equilibrium, ordered, random, complex
- Markov goes to a stochastic equilibrium ("statistical equilibrium")
    - that equilibrium is unique
- Lyapunov could be highly path dependent (remember the rugged landscape)
    - not stochastic equilibrium...hard, fixed equilibrium
    - starting conditions matter a lot
- "if you can construct a Lyaponuv function, then the system goes to equilibrium"
    - could also compute maximum time to equilibrium
    - the equilibrium found need not be unique or efficient
    - externalities pointing opposite are a reason systems don't go to equilibria
- systems that go up and down may not have equilibria
