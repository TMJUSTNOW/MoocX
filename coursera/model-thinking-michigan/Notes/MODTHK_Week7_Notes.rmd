####*Reading 1: Tipping Points*

[Tipping Points](http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~spage/ONLINECOURSE/R7Tips.pdf)

**A. Threshold and Tipping Points**

- "the most extreme form of nonlinearity would be a trend that takes a 90 degee turn"
    - examples: phase transitions, unstable points
- this might be situations in which making changes in one variable has no impact on the dependent variable...and then suddenly a small change has a huge impact
- "fitting a linear model to a system that's about to tip won't be informative about the future or about how the system performs given changes in variables"

**B. A First Definition of a Tipping Point**

- tipping point = "a value of variable at which small changes can induce large changes in the future state of the system"
- or.... "an action or outcome that dramatically reduces uncertainty about the future"
- like a Markov model, there is some assumption here that there are a finite number of possible states of the world
- but why do they exist? to the models!

**C. A Percolation Model**

- designed to address the question of whether a resource can flow across a network or a grid
    - in engineering, used to analyze whether fluids can flow through a solid
- the tipping point in this model is the "percolation threshold"
    - assume that you have water flowing down through a series of pipes along edges of boxes
    - every edge has some probability p of being open or closed
    - with slightly less than half of the pipes (randomly chosen) open, water will almost certainly not percolate
    - with slightly more than half of the pipes open, water almost certainly WILL percolate

####*Reading 2: Diffusion and SIS*

[Tipping Points](http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~spage/ONLINECOURSE/R7Diffusion.pdf)

**A. The S-Shaped Curve of Diffusion**

- diffusion models and models of chaos rely on *difference equations*, which describe how processes change over time

**B. The Contact Model**

- discrete time
- once you're infected you are always infected
- the process tends to grow slowly, then build rapidly, then slow down again
- the number of infected people always goes up in this model
- N isn't "all people" but "all people who could catch the disease"

**C. The SIS Model**

- like the contact model, but people are able to recover at some recovery rate $\alpha$
- a model that tells you how a disease spreads should also give you a sense of how many people you need to vaccinate

####*Reading 3: [Lamberson and Page: Tipping Points (INTRO ONLY)](http://www.santafe.edu/research/working-papers/abstract/aecbfc4c6f63132ad19706066c864f27/)

**A. Abstract**

- contextual tips make direct tips possible
    - e.g. human rights conditions in a state deteriorate creating the potential for an uprising

**B. Introduction**

- "...we use the mathematical formalism of dynamical systems to define tipping points as discontinuities in a relationship between present conditions and future states of the system"
- "...many apparent tipping points may not be tips given our formal definition but rather inevitable upticks in adoption rates driven by positive feedbacks"
- between-class tip causes movement between Wolfram's classes:
    - fixed point
    - periodic
    - random
    - complex
- a measure of tippiness --> based on change in the expected distribution over future outcomes
    - Diversity index or entropy
    
####*Video 7.1 - Tipping Points*

**A. Notes**

- "tipping" = small changes lead to big effects
- when people talk about tipping points, they mean "kinks in curves"
- a tipping point is a when a small change has a large effect
    - exponential growth can look like a tipping point, but it really isn't that
    - that's just the "inevitable process of growth"
- we're going to explore two models in this space
- types of tips:
    - direct tips: an action tips that same entity (battle to war)
    - contextual tips: environmental changes enable some other change
- tipping might be thought of as moving between Wolfram's four classes of system equlibria (stable, complex, random, repeating)

####*Video 7.2 - Percolation Models*

**A. How It Works**

- "the essence of modeling is to simplify things"
- the question: will rainwater percolate?
- this model can be applied to Forest Fires (see the model in NetLogo)
- the idea here is that water can only go from one open place to another:
    - think about a frog hopping across a fire through connected lilipads

**B. Fertility of Models**

- density of trees and relationship with fire spread
- could also be applied to bank failures
    - the density of lending relationships matters
- you might consider this in the context of country failures (e.g. sovereign default)

**C. Information Percolation**

- imagine a network of people
- transition probability - probability that when you hear something, you tell your friends
- the distribution of rumors is probably nonlinear
    - this is a result of information being spread through networks

**D. Innovation**

- why do we see a bunch of innovations in math and science all at once?
- think about it like "getting from point A to point B" by stitching together bits of knowledge
- think about innovation:
    - new technology starts "filling in intermediate squares"
    - at some point, the system tips and there are lots and lots of possible paths to the new invention
    - this explains a bunch of people inventing the same thing at about the same time

####*Video 7.3- Contagion Models 1: Diffusion*

**A. The SIS Model**

- SIS: "susceptible, infected, susceptible"
- SIR: "susceptible, infected, recovered"
- take some probability of transmission of the disease, probabilities of people with and without the disease meeting
- contact rate: how often do ANY people meet?
- the dynamics
    - early: few people who have it (can't spread fast)
    - middle: lots who have it, lots who don't (spreads fast)
    - end: lots who have it, few who don't (spread slows)
- diffusion equation:
    - $W_{t+1} = W_{t} + (Nc)\tau\frac{W_{t}}{N}(\frac{N-W_{t}}{N})$
- this is NOT a tipping point
    - this is natural diffusion
- just because you see a kink doesn't mean there's a tip

####*Video 7.4 - Contagion Models 2: SIS Model*

**A. The Difference**

- unlike in pure diffusion, in this model you can become susceptible (second S) again after having had the disease once
- the equation is now:
    - $W_{t+1} = W_{t} + (Nc)\tau\frac{W_{t}}{N}(\frac{N-W_{t}}{N}) - aW_{t}$
    - where $aW_{t}$ captures the people who get re-infected
- when you write models, it's useful to be good at algebra
- basic reproduction number:
    - $R_{0} = c\tau/a$
    - R_{0} > 1 --> disease spreads!
- given V = % vaccinated
    - $R_{0}(1-V) = r_{0}$
    - if $R_{0}(1-V) <= 1$ the disease will not spread
- we need $V >= 1-\frac{1}{R_{0}}$ to stop the spread
- this model gives us a tipping point and policy
    - it tells you that vaccination has no "population-level" effect short of the threshold
- In this model, $R_{0}$ represents the tipping point

####*Video 7.5 - Classifying Tipping Points*

**A. Dynamical Systems**

- when perturbed, the system will move in some direction (toward an equilbrium or at least a point of attraction)
- a tippoing point = "unstable equilibrium"

**B. Direct Tip**

- this is when a tiny change in the variable itself leads to a large change on the end state of that same variable
- we usually focus on the direct tips, but sometimes we have changes in the context
- "the variable bootstraps itself"

**C. Contextual Tips**

- change in the environment by a tiny bit that has a huge effect on the end state
    - more squares in percolation
    - more connections in social network

**D. Between and Within Class**

- within class (from one equilibrium to another)
- between class (switching between periodic, complex, chaotic, stable equilibrium)

####*Video 7.6 - Measuring Tips*

**A. Active Tip**

- one the tip occurs, the outcome is locked in
    - initially there was some uncertainty, and then it goes away
    - we can measure "tippiness" by "reductions in uncertainty

**B. Diversity Index**

- given 4 outcomes:
    - A (0.25), B(0.25), C(0.25), D(0.25)
- first compute two people of the same type meeting
    - P~ii~ = P~i~^2
    - sum of these = 1/4
    - DI = 1/ (1/4) = 4
- a different example:
    - A(1/2), B(1/3), C(1/6)
    - sum of same-type probs = 14/36
    - DI = 36/14 = 2.55 roughly (about 2.55 different things)
- if DI is lower after the tip, then the number of possible states has gone way down

**C. Entropy**

- $-\sum\limits_{i=1}^n P_{i}log_{2}(P_{i})$
- for the (4 cases with 0.25 probability) case, Entropy =2
- Entropy tells us "the number of bits you need to know to identify the outcome"
    - think about binary search
- when you know with certainty, entropy = 0
- "tippiness" can be measured by how much diversity index or entropy changes

**D. What Tips Are**

- tips = changes in likelihood of outcomes. NOT kinks in curves
