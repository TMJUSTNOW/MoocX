# [Model Thinking] (https://www.coursera.org/modelthinking/)

====================================

## Intelligent Citizens of the World

### **Models tie us to logic**

They get used by:

- Economists 
- Biologist (brain, species)
- Socioligy (identity)
- Political Science (Voting)
- Linguistics (structure of a language)
- Law (what judge a court appoints)
- Game Theory (Strategic Behaviour)

### **Models are better than we are**

- Help us predict better


### **Models are fertile**

- You can apply them to different situations
- Figure out who wrote a book (Markov Chains)


### **Models make us humble**

- Prediction models and logic makes one realize the importance of things


## Thinking More Clearly

*First step to writing a model is to* **Name The Parts**

Suppose you want to go to the restaurant

Relevant Parts:

- Restaurant1, Restaurant2, Restaurant3, Restaurant4
- Shoes, clothing
- Money he has
- Time it takes to get the food
- What kind of food you like

Irrelevant Parts:

- If he has a hat
- How tall he is

#### Models allow you to understand class of outcome

There are 4 outputs of a model:

- Equilibrium
- Cycle
- Random
- Complex

#### Models allow you to Identify Logical Boundaries

```
Two heads are better than one
Too many cooks spoil the broth
```

**Which one do you follow?**

Models allow you to determine conditions in which you should follow them

#### Models allow you to communicate

**How do people vote?**

Theres a `voter`, a `candiate_1` and a `candidate_2`

Where the candidates have a likability `L`

Voters determine how likable the candidates are and how close they are to them in policies that suits and appeals to them.


## Using and Understanding Data

Data is used to :

1. Understand Patterns
2. Predict Points (buying a house) [price / point value]
3. Produce Bounds
4. Retrodiction (use models to predict the past)
5. Helps you predict other stuff
6. Inform Data Collection
7. Estimate Hidden Parameters
8. Calibrate


## Using Models to Decide, Strategize, and Design

### Decision Aids

**Monty Hall Problem***

- You have 3 doors and you pick one
- Monty knows which one has the price
- Once you choose the door, Monty opens one of the other door
- Then he asks you if you want to switch your chosen door

**What do you do?**

**Answer:** Switch

##### Math

Lets assume you have 3 doors


*Your perspective:*

Probability of choosing the winning door : `1/3`

Probability of choosing the loosing door : `2/3`


*Monty's Perspective:*

He gets rid of 1 door

Nothing happens and Probability of choosing the winning door : `2/3`


### Comparitive Statics

You move from one equilibrium to another.

When the demands are shipped out, the quantity goes up and the price goes up

### Counterfactuals

Help us figure out it a policy was in fact a good decision or not

### Identify and Rank Levers

For global warming for example, you might want to figure out where the numbers are large

### Experimental Design

Suppose you want to come up with a new policy, you use experiments to test the model out

### Institutional Design

**Social Choice Function**

### Help Choose Among Policies and Institutions

Ex: Should a city contain mode parks ?

Yes , why not but what if the public doesnt like those choices in that particular area
