####*Video 1.1.1 - Course Overviews*

**A. Notes**

- by engineers, for engineers
- the course is concerned with "how to transmit information wirelessly?"
- the course will be three parts:
    1. Point - to - point (one user to one user)
    2. Sharing a channel (multiple users)
    3. Network - links between channels/"base stations"
- network has to adapt to time-varying endpoints (imagine talking on your phone while in the car)
    - redundancy matters

**B. This Part**

- point-to-point = single source talking with single destination
- lots of different subtopics in this
- message from one place to another over a "channel", probably with "noise"
- if we have a system prone to errors, how can we correct for those errors?

####*Video 1.1.2 - Basic Communication System*

**A. Notes**

- single source encodes some information (bits), receiver decodes that
    - hopefully it looks the same after decoding
- \textbf{transmitter} = takes a sequence of bits (0 or 1) and creates a physical signal or waveform (e.g. time varying voltage or light intensity) that is carried over a channel
- \textbf{channel} = a wire, the air, a fiber optic cable...may modify the signal as it carries it
- \textbf{receiver} = tries to figure out what the transmitted bits were (decode them) from the received signal

**B. What Are Bits?**

- a bit is the basic unit of information
- it is a boolean...the answer to a yes or no question
- sequences of bits can be used to encoded complicated information

**C. Representing Bits**

- physical media for transmitting information:
    - light (1 = on, 0 = off)
    - voltage (1 = high, 0 = low)
    - current (1 = positive, 0 = negative)
- any physical variables could send 0s and 1s

**D. Time-Based Representations**

- hold the variable constant for a certain amount of time
- "bit time"...each bit is on or off over this time
    - try to make bit time as short as possible
- lower bit time = you can send more in the same time
- faster transmission = more strain on the communication system

**E. Channel**

- the transmitter sends the waveform representing the bit sequence to the receiver over a channel
- transforming the physical variable over the channel introduces errors
- a light waveform might be sent over a fiber optic link (itnernet) or even just air (TV remote)
- source --> transmitter --> channel --> receiver --> destination

**F. Summary**

- the transmitter translates information into a physical waverform
- the receiver takes that physical waveform as an input and translates back into digital bits

####*Video 1.1.3 - Encoding Information with Bits*

**A. Review**

- a bit is the basic unit of information in a communication system-
- a bit is a boolean (yes/no answers)
- combinations of bits (transmitted as sequences over time) are used to encode complex information

**B. Binary Numbers**

- each value is the sums of powers of two
- leftmost bit = Most Significant Bit (MSB)
- rightmost = Least Significant Bit (LSB)
- significance of bits decreases as we move from left to right in a binary number
- 5 encoded with bits is ```101```
- more bits = more bit combinations = more possibilities
- think of binary numbers as a decision tree
    - as you work your way through the "yes/no" questions from left to right, you get smaller and smaller buckets of possible numbers
    - this is like "binary search" in the "guess the number" game
- the most information is contained in the MSB

**C. ASCII Codes**

- an old code for capturing text
    - Unicode is used more today
- a code that assigns a particular bit sequence to symbols
- symbols represented in a bunch of 8-bit sequences
- sequences transmitted in a "flipped" fashion...LSB first
- rememebr that a bit corresponds to a physical variable that encodes yes/no
- "even though we've restricted ourselves to a bit, which corresponds to a physical variable that assumes only two possible values, by using sequences of bits, we can actually transmit much, much more complex kinds of information'

####*Video 1.1.4 - Lab Overview*

**A. Notes**

- the lab sessions is intended to help you see what it's like to build a real communication system
- communication systems help us transmit information from one location to another
- LED = "light emitting diodes"
- LED as transmitter, universal software radio peripheral (USRP) as receiver

####*Video 1.2.1 - Continuous vs Discrete Time Waveforms*

**A. Notes**

- bit time = how long you hold a bit constant
- most of out representations in this class will be discrete-time

**B. Continuous vs. Discrete Time Signals**

- continuous - you can make a measurement at any point
    - probably a smoothed version of discrete measurements
- discrete - measurement only happens at discrete intervales

**C. Sampling: Continuous to Discrete**

- obtain discrete waveform by sampling
- you can go from continuous backwards as well
- \textbf{zero-order hold}:
    - start at 0 (which you know with perfect accuracy)
    - hold for a certain amount of time, assume it jumps to the continuous measurement, hold again, jump, etc.

**D. Other Approaches**

- shorter sample interval = better approximation of the continuous waveform
- sample period (T~s~) = time between two samples
    - typical unit = seconds
- sample frequency (F~s~) = how many samples we take in a fixed period of time
    - typical unit = Hertz (Hz, samples per seconds)
- F~s~ = 1/T~s~
- a higher sample frequency is:
    - Good: less ifnormation lost since less time between samples
    - Bad: more storage needed since more samples for a given length of time
- Sampling a signal of length T~w~ with a sample period T~s~ results in N samples where:
    - N = $\frac{T_w}{T_s}$ = ${T_w}*{F_s}$

**E. Extras**

- CDs records two channels (left and right) of music at a sampling frequency of F~s~ = 44.1 kHz. If each sample is encoded with 16 bits, and one byte is 8 bits, how many bytes are required to store on minute of music?
- Samples taken = [samples/s(Hz)] x [total seconds] x [number of channels]
- bits to store the samples = [samples taken] x [bits per sample]
- bytes to encode = [bits] / 8

####*Video 1.2.2 - Discrete Time Bit Waveforms*

**A. Notes**

- the bit time is the actual time it takes to send one bit
- the \textbf{bit rate} measures the number of 1/bit_time
    - the bit rate measures the numbers of bits we can send in a given unit of time
    - bit equals sampling frequency / samples per bit
- we want high bit rate, small bit time
- 1 megahertz = 1 million samples per second

####*Video 1.2.3 - Representing Bit Waveforms*

**A. Equivalent Waveform Representations**

- verbal = "encoding of the bit sequence 0010001 at 4 samples per bit"
- graphical - up and down graph
- computer prefers lists, vectors
- sum of unit step functions

**B. Functions to Specify Waveforms**

- a function maps an input to an output
- "unit step function"
    - equal to 0 for all values less than n
    - equal to 1 for all values greater than n
- augment it by adding a delay, ```d```
- we can then build complex waveforms by linearly combining unit steps
- sum and difference unit steps and delayed unit steps to create any waveform
- formulaic way to do this:
    - if the bit changes from 0 to 1 at sample D, add u(n-D)
    - if the bit changes from 1 to 0 at sample D, subtracte u(n-D)
    - to do nothing, do nothing!
- "the unit step formulation is a very powerful way for us to take a relatively complicated waveform and at least write a formula in terms of simple formulas that we can understand"

####*Video 1.3.1 - What is Matlab?*

**A. Notes**

- Using Matlab to solve problems too complicated to solve by hand
- Matlab creator Cleve Muller took scientific code (i.e. Fortran) and encoded it in functions

####*Video 1.4.1 - A Communication Example*

**A. Notes**

- steps:
    - use ```text2bitseq()``` to translate a string into binary sequence
    - tell LED to hold for 50 microseconds
    - set SPB = 50
    - use ```bitseq2waveform()``` to take that bit sequence and transmit to wave form
