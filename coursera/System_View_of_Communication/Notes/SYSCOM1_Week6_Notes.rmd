####*Video 6.1.1 - Lab 9 - Repetition Code*

**A. Notes**

- two types of code so far: repetition code and block code
- "the additive noise will cause bit error rate to increase whenever the noise value is high"
- repetition code takes advantage of the independence property of Gaussian noise:
    - the noise affecting two different bits is unrelated
- repetition code can improve communication performance
    - increasing transmission power helps no matter what code you use

####*Video 6.1.2 - Parity Bit Codes*

**A. Single Parity Bit Code**

- given a k-bit message, we can create a (k+1, k,2) block code by adding a single bit
    - the bit is chosen as that the sum of the (k+1) bits in the codeword is even
    - the final bit is called the parity bit
    - code rate = 7/8
    - Hamming distance is 2
        - even number of bits...you have to change 2 bits to change even-ness

**B. Error Detection**

- with (k+1, k+2) parity bit code, we can detect single bit errors
- if the received codeword has an even number of ones, we assume no bit errors have occurred. Otherwise, we assume a one bit error has occurred
- we cannot detect a 2-bit error

**C. An (8,4,3) Code**

- we are sending 4-bit messages
- rearrange the message into a square
    - choose a parity bit for each row and column such that every row and column has an even number of bits

**D. Syndrome Bits**

- the syndrome bits check, for every parity bit, if the corresponding conditions are met
- if all the syndrome bits are 0, then there were no bit errors
- if we have two syndrome bits that are one, and they intersect with each other, we must look for a single bit error that would cause both 1s
- with d=3, you're looking for 1-bit and 2-bit errors

**E. Error Correction Summary**

1. take an input message stream
2. break it into 4-bit blocks
3. add the 4 parity bits
4. transmit codewords through noisy channel and maybe pick up errors
5. perform error correction
6. extract the k=4 message bits from each corrected codeword

**F. Summary**

- noise, always present in communication systems, lead to bit errors
- Shannon: Error Correcting Codes can be used to reduce bit error rate
- with (n,k,d) block codes, we use n bits to encode k message bits, where n > k
- the minimum Hamming distance, d, between the codewords indicates how many bit errors the code can detect or correct

####*Video 6.1.3 - Lab 10: Parity Bit Code*

**A. Notes**

- repetition code can improve the bit error detection
- using parity checking codes helps us to detect errors introduced by the receiver
    - won't simply repeat the information bit, but will add a parity bit to monitor the information bits
    - receiver: computer syndrome bits
- we achieve the performance improvement at the cost of transmission time
- we have a tradeoff betweeen the bit error performance and the transmission time we want to use for different coding schemes
- "in reality, we are going to face this kind of trade-off in many design problems"

####*Video 6.1.4 - (9,4,4) Code*

**A. Notes**

- (9,4,4) --> 9 total bits, 4 bits of information, Hamming distance of d=4
- we add an additional parity bit, P5
- by doing this, "we increase the minimum Hamming distance between valid code words to 4. That will allow us to do either correcting of 1-bit errors and detection o 2-bit errors or detection of 1-, 2-, and 3- bit errors
- we'll add just one more syndrome bit
- if the syndrome bits are all 0, assume no bit errors
- if that final syndrome bit is 1, the received code must have odd parity, so we can assume a 1-bit error
    - find that 1-bit error which would correct everything
- if we only see one syndrome bit equal to 1, assume that the data are correct and this is an error at the receiver
- we can detect a 2-bit error (if that final syndrome bit is 0 but we have other 1 syndrome bits)
    - i.e. the received codeword met the parity check
    - there are multiple 2-bit errors possible

####*Video 6.1.5 - Burst Error Correction*

**A. Notes**

- we have a short period of time where an intense soruce of interference causes a ton of errors all at once
- all along, we've been assuming a limited number of errors (1 or 2 out of 4)
- one workaround is to read codewords "by column" (e.g. 1st bit of all code words, then 2nd bit, etc.)
- this slows things down a lot

**B. Framing**

- looking at a received bit stream: "how do we know where a block of interleaved coedwords beings?"
- possible solutions:
    - physical indication
    - frame sync sequence
    - a unique bit patter place to mark start of a block (like start bit)
    - however, we need to handle one more thing before handling the sync sequence

**C. Bit Stuffing: Motivation **

- if the sync sequence is [011110], one way to guarantee the sync sequence never appears in the data block is to make sure there are never five 1's in a row
- bit stuffing:
    - scan through the data block
    - whenever the sender finds four consecutive 1's, it stuffs (adds) a 0 to into the outgoing stream
    - the 0 is ALWAYS stuffed whether or not the next bit is 1
- unstuffing:
    - whenever the receiver sees four consecutive 1's, it unstuffs (removes) the next bit (which will be a 0)

**D. Summing up Channel Coding and decoding**

1. Take an input message
2. Break it into k-bit blocks
3. add (n-k) parity bits
4. Interleave bits from B codewords (to prevent burst errors)
5. bit-stuff
6. add sync pattern
7. Send bit stream
8. received bit stream (with errors)
9. search for and remove sync pattern (could be lost becaues of errors)
10. Destuff the frame
11. de-interleave to form B n-bit codewords
12. Perform error correction
13. Extract the k=4 corrected message bits

####*Video 6.2.1 - Communication Protocols*

**A. Notes**

- we've discussed one source - one destination communication
- the source and destination need to agree on protocols

**B. Communication Protocols**

- a communication protocol is an agreement between the transmitter and receiver that allows them to communicate
- protocols are necessary for any communication system
- in data communication, protocols cover all aspects of data representation and signaling
- frame size
- synchronization (start/stop bits)
- representation of individual bits (e.g. the bit time)
    - tradeoff between speed and accuracy
- training sequences to detect channel properties

**C. Metrics for Communication Systems**

- bit rate = the number ofb its transmitted per second
    - we want this to be large
    - bit rate is inversely proportional to bit time (SPB)
- bit error rate (BER) = the fraction of received bits that are received with errors
    - we want this to be small
- tradeoffs: BER decreases
    - as bit rate decreases
    - as channel noise decreases
    - as signal transmit power increases
    - shape of tradeoff between bit rate and bit error rate is affected by the properties of the channel
