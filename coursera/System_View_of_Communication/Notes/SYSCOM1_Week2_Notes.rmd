####*Video 2.1.1 - The Discrete Time Channel*

**A. Notes**

- we can go back and forth between continuous and discrete time with sampling
- we can replicate many waveforms with sums and differences of unit steps
- come up with a way of describing how we come up with a way of describing how we go from a discrete time input to the channel to the actual response of the channel on the other side, at the receiver
- "engineers use models all the time"
    - understand the operation of the system
    - predict performance (what are the limitations?)
    - develop modifications to the system that improve performance

####*Video 2.1.2 - The Effects of the Channel*

**A. Notes**

- there may be some attenuation...more gradual changes between high and low
    - attenuation = decrease in amplitude
- there is some delay
    - the physical waveform can't make truly instantaneous changes
- lowest level may not be 0
- blurring of the transition
    - changes are not instantaneous
- y(n) = kx(n-d) + c
    - y(n) = value of the waveform at time n
    - k = attenuation (k < 1)
    - d = delay (horizontal)
    - c = offset (might never actually get back down to 0)
- transducer: turns signal from bits to physical waveform

**B. Blurring of transitions**

- blurring is caused by:
    - the transducer that creates the physical waveform
    - the electronics that drive the transducer
    - the physical medium that carries the waveform
    - the sensor that senses the physical waveform
    - the electronics that process the sensor signal
- \textbf{bandlimited channel} = a channel which cannot change instantaneously
- we know how to describe the input waveform using unit steps...can we define the output one (which has all these other effects)?
    - yes! we can if we assume that the channel is linear and time invariant

####*Video 2.1.3 - Linear Time Invariant Systems*

**A. Notes**

- two properties of lineary
- homogeneity:
    - if f(x) = y, f(ax) = ay
- additivity;
    - if f(x_1) = y_1 and f(x_2) = y_2, then f(x_1 + x_2) = y_1 + y_2
- if you know a funciton is linear, then you can compute the output for any nonzero input using homogeneity and additivity

**B. What is a System?**

- takes a waveform x(n) in and outputs another wave form y(n)
- a linear system satisfies the same properties as linear functions...homogeneity and additivity

**C. Time Invariance**

- a system is time invariant if when you delay the input by d, the output is the same, just delayed by d
- if a system is LTI, you can find the output just by knowing the output to almost any non-zero input function
- we choose the unit step function as the input
- the output of a system which takes in a unit-step input is the \textbf{step response}
    - this is a property of the system
    
**D. Computing Output of an LTI System**

- decompose into combination of scaled unit steps
- use linear properties to predict the pieces of the equation
- "additivity to combine individual responses"

####*Video 2.1.4 - Modeling the Channel*

**A. Notes**

- exponential step response:
    - changes in amplitude (k)
    - blurring of transitions (a)
- $s(n) = k(1-a^{n+1})u(n)$
    - 0 < a < 1
- u(n) equal to 1 for all values greater than 0
- smaller a = faster convergence

**B. At the Receiver**

- the signal also includes some noise
- the receiver's job is to figure out the original bit waveform

####*Video 2.1.5 - Lab 2: Step Response*

**A. Notes**

- the purpose of this lab is to determine the step response of our channel
- the step response = the reponse of the channel to a step function
- "we observe an offset signal, which comes from the ambient light in this room"
- "we observe an offset, which comes from transmission delay and processing time on the board"
- "we observe an exponential channel response, where the channel response increases from its minimum value to its maximum value gradually"
- you can use the "data cursor" to find data on a plot
- the "k" parameter is the range
- as the transmission distance increases, the valeu of the signal range parameter k decreases

####*Video 2.2.1 - Communication Protocols*

**A. Notes**

- the question is always "how can we recover the original bitstream at the point of the receiver?"

**B. Channel response to a Bit Sequence**

- question: how do we recoever the original bit stream?
- a protocol is an agreement on a set of rules or procedures to follow during communication
- protocols are necessary for any communication system
    - if the transmitter does not follow the protocol, the receiver may be able to "hear" what is being said, but not "understand" it

**C. Protocols in Data Communication System**

- protocols cover all aspects of data representation and signaling including:
1. The representation of text characters
    - ASCII vs. Unicode
2. The order in which bit sequences are sent
    - LSB or MSB first
3. The representation of individual bits
    - e.g. 1 = light on, 0 = light off
4. The bit time (SPB) or bit rate
5. training sequence
6. Synchronization method

####*Video 2.2.2 - Thresholding*

**A. Notes**

- in our system:
    - 1 bit usually close to c+k
    - 0 bit usually results in received values close to c
- this suggests we can recover original bits by comparing received value with a theshold T
    - intuitively, we might choose halfway between (c+k) and c
- the \textbf{training sequence} helps the receiver figure out c and k
    - the idea is to help the system understand the nature of the channel
    - basic idea is that you send a burst of bits and measure response

**B. Length of the training sequence**

- there is a tradeoff
    - shorter equals less wasted time, but less reliable estimate of the range
    - longer more wasted time, more reliable estiamte of the range
- the choice of the pulse width is based on an assumption about the value of "a" in the step response
    - smaller a = faster convergence, implies shorter pulse width needed
- a will not change much
- larger a suggests larger pulse width

####*Video 2.2.3 - Asynchronous Serial Communication*

**A. Sub-Sampling**

- send one waveform
- receive a different one
- use thresholding to try to recover original bitstream
- we have many samples (corresponding to SPB) representing one bit
- \textbf{sub-sampling} means taking a subset of samples to try to figure out the bits
- how do we know non-transmission doesn't just respond to a 0 bit?

**B. Asynchronous Communication**

- In many communication systems, the transmitter and receiver are not synchronized (aligned in time)
- the receiver does not know when the transmitter will transmit data
- this type of communication is known as an \textbf{asynchronous link}
- in this type of link, the receiver needs a signal from the transmitter indicating when it starts to transmit data

**C. Framing**

- in asynchronous communication:
    - data bits grouped into blocks
    - blocks are "framed", i.e. surrounded by extra bits
- framing bits:
    - start bit - indicates the start of a data transmission
    - stop bits - allow for time between transmission
- data block plus framing bits is called a frame

**D. Start Bits**

- tell the receiver the transmitter has something to send
- the start bit iis chosen to be 0 or 1 (choose something non-usual)

**E.Data Block**

- for the receiver to know how long to listen, the transmitter and receiver must agree upon how many bits will follow the start bit. We will refer to these bits as a "character" or "data block"
- this is where protocols come in
- too few bits: add zeros to the end (padding)
- too many bits: split the bits to multiple blocks
- in the protocols, something there is value in just making a choice, regardless of what that choice is
- 160 bytes is the normal number of characters in SMS
    - in modern smartphones, the communication will still break your texts into 160 and then weave them back together
    - phone company will charge you in number of SMS chunks
    
**F. Stop Bits**

- in some cases, we add one or more stop bits to the end of each frame to allow time for the receiver to process the frame
- the stop bits are chosen so that the received signal is the same as when the channel is idel so that the new start bit can be detected
- using more stop bits provides mroe time between data blocks:
    - advantage: the receiver has mroe time to process the frame
    - disadvantage: reduces the rate at which we can send information
- in modern telecomm systems, we rarely use stop bits (the electronics are so fast)
- stop bits are chosen so the received signal is the same as the channel idle level
    - allows us to easily distinguish between stop bit and start of new start bit

####*Video 2.2.4 - A Simple Protocol*

**A. Sub-Sampling**

- transmitter
    1. Input sequence
    2. Data block
    3. Framing
    4. Sample waveform (remember the SPB, "bit rate")
    5. Add training sequence at the beginning (maybe periodicially if we have a time-variant channel)
- receiver
    1. Use the training sequence to estimate c and k (threshold = (c+k)/2)
    2. Skip paste the training sequence
    3. Find beginning of the start bit
    4. Decode (figure out) the bit stream by comparing samples spaced SPB apart starting from an estimate of the end of the first bit, which is the beginning of the start bit plus 2*SPB - 1
