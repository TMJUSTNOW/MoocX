####*Video 3.1 - Overview of Investment Planning*

**A. Notes**

- Set your financial goals
- Establish timelines
- Determine how much money you will need for each goal
    - How much do I need?
    - When will I need it?
    - What will inflation do to the cost of my goals?
- Choose a less-risky portfolio for near-term goals (money-market certificates, bonds, etc.)
- For longer-term, might as well hold higher-risk (like common stock)
- Step 1: Determine the appropriate asset Mix
- Step 2: Create an investment plan
- Step 3: Choose investments based on the criteria established in your investment plan
- Step 4: Don't make too many adjustments. Stick to the plan!
- IRA= "Individual Retirement Account"
- Max IRA contribution: $5,000/year

####*Video 3.2 - Diversification*

**A. Notes**

- Ben Graham published "Security Analysis" in 1930s
- Fundamental Analysis --> looking at the characteristics of the firm, not just its stocks
- "Buy good companies, not good stocks"
- Harry Markowitz --> "Portfolio Selection"
    - pointed out the risk/return tradeoff
    - Won Nobel Prize in Economics for the idea that an investor should be concerned about a security's contribution to overall risk, not just its return
- Milton Friedman questioned Markowitz 's theories
- By increasing the number of securities in a portfolio, the amount of unsystematic risk can be almost completely eliminated. This is known as "diversifiable risk"
- Systematic (Market Risk) cannot be diversified away
- Diversification: Both between and within asset categories
- optimal number of securities is about 30
- You could "diversify" by buying mutual funds or ETFs
    - mutual funds make it easier to own a small part of a diversified portfolio
    
####*Video 3.3 - Market Timing*

**A. Notes**

- attempting to time the market is a loser's game
- An investor attempts to predict the future position of the market
- It's nearly impossible
- Day traders are market-timers
- Active traders have a failure rate of about 80%
- Individuals almost always do worse than the market as a whole
- Unhealthy cycle of greed and fear inherent in timing behavior
- "Most active investors actually do follow a buy high, sell low strategy. Individual investors buy stocks after the price has increased."
- \textbf{the herding effect} - the tendency to sell in a bear market and buy in a bull market....following the crowd
- just establish a long-term strategy and stick to it

####*Video 3.4 - Patience and Persistence*

**A. Notes**

- "common sense investing"
- passive investment management (Jack Bogle, found/CEO of Vanguard)- Buy and hold, essentially
    - "The Little of Common Sense Investing"
    - "The Bogleheads Guide to Investing"
- The Bogle philosophy
    - develop a workable plan
    - invest early and often
    - never bear too much or too little risk
    - keep costs low
    - minimize taxes
    - use index funds
- "In investing, you get what you don't pay for. Costs matter."
- Vanguard is not an establishment favorite ??? they insist on only index funds/ETFs
    - active managers are not too pleased with this
- "Intelligent investors must accept the fact that, over time, the funds they select, irrespective of past performance, will inevitably revert toward the mean"
- Index funds cost about 1/5th of the average of the active mutual funds
    - mutual funds need more analytical power and therefore cost more
- It is difficult (if not impossible) to select the best-performing mutual fund beforehand
