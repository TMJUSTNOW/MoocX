REGMODS_Project
===============

A repo to store my final project for the Regression Models course in the Johns Hopkins University Data Science specialization on Coursera.


**The Assignment**

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

*“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?”*
*"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"*


**Files in this Repo**

I wrote the supporting code behind the pdf version of the report using the latest distribution of [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/). The file Motor_Trend_Report_Project.rmd in this repo contains the underlying code. All statistical analysis and plotting is accomplished via R, and report formatting uses a combination of LaTeX, HTML, and R markdown.

The file Motor_Trend_Report_Project.pdf contains the more presentable pdf output of the .rmd version. This pdf was submitted as the final deliverable for the class.

**A Note on Formatting**

The project description explicitly called for the pdf to be compiled in knitr. However, it did not say that formatting had to be done *exclusively* in Rmd. I did use Rmd formatting and knit to pdf using knitr (not Sweave), but there is a decent amount of LaTeX formatting in my project as well. If you've arrived here as a grader, I ask you to please give me full points for the question asking "Did they use Rmd (knitr) to create the pdf?".
