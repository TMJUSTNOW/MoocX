## Software Engineering for SaaS

### Overview

This course is an opinionated path through the bewildering array of methodologies, languages, tools, and artifact types that collectively make up “software engineering.” The goal is to instill good software habits—testability, software architecture, modularity, and reusability—while providing the gratification of building a working deployed artifact in the cloud in just 5 weeks. We teach Agile Development in the context of building and deploying a Software-as-a-Service application implemented using Ruby on Rails.
