PML Project Notes:


Sensors on four locations (glove, armband, lumbar belt, dumbbell):
	- 8 features (mean, var, sd, max, min, amplitude, kurtosis, skewness) of three Euler angles (roll, pitch yam)


4 x 8 x 3 = 96 features

Selected Set:

1. Belt:
 {} Mean roll
 {} Variance of roll
 {} maximum of accelerometer vector
 {} variance of the gyro
 {} variance of the magnetometer

2. Arm:
 {} variance of accelerometer
 {} maximum magnetometer
 {} minimum of magnetometer

3. Dumbbell:
 {} maximum of acceleration
 {} variance of gyro
 {} maximum and minimum of magnetometer

4. glove:
 {} sum of pitch
 {} maximum of gyro
 {} minimum of gyro




They used a Random Forest approach, using an ensemble of classifiers using bagging.
	- 10 random forests and each forest was implemented with 10 trees
	- the classifier was tested with 10-fold CV and different windows sizes

Also use leave-one-out test in order to measure whether classifier trained for some subjects is still useful for a new subject.
