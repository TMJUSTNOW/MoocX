####*Video 2.1.1 - Hitting Metrics*

**A. Some Terminology**

- sacrifice fly = SF
- sacrifice hit = SH
- outcomes of plate appearance:
    - hits
    - outs
    - reach base on error
    - fielder's choice
    - walk
    - hit by pitch
    - defensive interference
- At-Bat not the same as Plate Appearance
- what counts in an AB:
    - hit
    - reaching on an error
    - non-sacrifice out
    - fielder's choice
- plate appearances = everything
- batting average suggested to Chadwick in 1872
- batting title eligibility:
    - 3.1 AB per games played by team

####*Video 2.1.2 - Issues with Batting Averages*

**A. Some Evidence**

- there is a significant positive correlation between batting average and runs scored (at the team level) over history
    - R^2^ around 0.67
- "league factor" - in time series data, you have different regimes/environments producing different data
- consider positive correlation between team HRA and team runs allowed
    - one era with low scoring, another with high scoring
- "runs are the currency of the game"

####*Video 2.1.3 - Hitting Metrics Continued*

**A. More Correlation Work**

- batting average is a bit blunt
    - we should care about the type of hits (home runs, singles, etc.)
- correlation between HR and team runs scored is a bit lower than hits
- On base percentage (OBP) - R^2^ of around 78% in explaining variation in runs scored
- slugging (totals bases divided by at bats) is even better...around 82% R^2^
- OPS = on-base plus slugging
    - this explains 89% of the variation in runs scored
- Runs created = (H + BB)\*(Total_Bases)/(AB + BB)
    - 92% correlation
    
####*Reading 1 - Linear Weights*

**A. Notes**

- see [HERE](http://www.fangraphs.com/library/principles/linear-weights/)
- "with play-by-play data, we can actually look at any class of event and find out the average change said event causes in run expectancy"
- linear weight = converting events into their value (in runs)
- linear weights are optimised for the average game, but perform poorly in extreme settings
- the idea --> is double is more important (in terms of runs) than a single, but not twice as important
- there are 24 unique base/out states
- RE24 value for a player = subtract Run Expectancy value from before his at bat from the value after
    - if run expectancy went up, he contributed positively
- it is a context-dependent measure
    - how you do is as important as the situations youcome to bat in
- a context-independent alternative is wOBA (weighted on base average)
- Woba weights = average RE for a given event (single, double, etc.) in a given year
- ISO (isolated slugging) - extra base hits per at bat
    - slugging minus average

####*Video 2.2.1 - Descriptive Stats: The Mean*

**A. Notes**

- descriptive statistics --> Collection, Organization, Presentation, Summarization
- central tendency = mean, median, mode
- spread = range, minimum, maximum
- distribution = variance, standard deviation
- mean = sum / number of obs

####*Video 2.2.2 - Descriptive Stats: Continued*

**A. Notes**

- median is the "middle" of the data
    - equal density of obseravtions on both sides
- mode is the most common data point
    - you can, and often will, have many modes
    
####*Video 2.2.3 - Descriptive Stats: Spread and Variability*

**A. Notes**

- range = max - min
- interquartile range = 75% quartile - 25% quartile
- percentiles = 90th percentile = "top 10% cutoff"

####*Video 2.2.4 - Descriptive Stats: Distribution*

**A. Notes**

- average absolute distribution
- variance, standard deviation
- variance = (1/N-1) * sum of squared variations from the mean
- standard deviation = square root of variance
- coefficient of variation = relative stdev = stdev / sample mean
    - dimensionless variable
    - allows you to compare variability across different datasets

####*Video 2.2.5 - Descriptive Stats: The Bonds Distribution References*

**A. Notes**

- a histogram is a bar chart of frequencies

####*Video 2.2.6 - Descriptive Stats: Symmetric Distributions*

**A. Notes**

- MLB Advanced Media Hit f/x ... angle of hits 
- for symmetric distributions, mean=median=mode

####*Video 2.2.7 - Descriptive Stats: Skewed Distributions*

**A. Notes**

- pitch f/x... data on pitch angles ("breaks")
- in non-symmetrical distributions, mean, median, and mode look very different
