####*Video 3.1 - Designing a Data Model*

**A. Notes**

- this is an art form
- our goal it to avoid really bad mistakes and make something useful

**B. Building a Data Model**

- drawing a picture of the data objects for our application and then figuring out how to represent the objects and their relationships
- basic rule: don't put the same string data in twice - use a relationship instead
- when there is one thing in the "real world", there should be one copy of that thing in the db
- strings are way more expensive to store than integers
- model the real world!
- with spreadsheets, you end up replicating data many many times
- where do we start? think about what the most essential thing is
- "the data model creates the features of the application"
    - you have to get the data model right for the application to have the capabilities you want
	
####*Video 3.2 - Representing a Data Model in Tables*

**A. Notes**

- go from "logical" to "physical" model of the data
- primary keys...unique integers identifying rows w/in tables
- foreign keys...primary keys in other tables. Used to create links between tables
- logical key...a unique thing to look up a row from the outside world (something you might use in where clause)
- it's more important that there IS naming convention

**B. Let's get down to business**

- how we might add a primary key:

```
CREATE TABLE Artist (
	id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
	name TEXT
);
```

####*Video 3.3 - Inserting Relational Data*

**A. Notes**

- you don't need to specify the primary key when inserting because it auto-updates/increments
- for example:

```
INSERT INTO Genre (name) VALUE ('Rock')
INSERT INTO Genre (name) VALUE ('Trap')
```

- inserting with a foreign key

```
INSERT INTO Album (title, artist_id) values ('Who Made Who',2)
INSERT INTO Album (title, artist_id) values ('TNT', 1)
```

- a more complex statement with lots of foreign keys:

```
INSERT INTO Track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id) VALUES ('Black Dog', 5, 297, 0, 2, 1)
```

- it's ok to have replication, as long as they're numbers (far far far less storage space required)
- in DBs, you're trying to reduce the amount of data that has to be scanned to get to a particular piece of information

####*Video 3.4 - Reconstructing data with JOIN*

**A. Notes**

- we've built a "web" of information that should scale
- "you tend to do large things professionally"
- the JOIN operation links across several tables as part of a select operation
- for example:

```
SELECT Album.title, Artist.name FROM Album JOIN Artist ON Album.artist_id = Artist.id
```

- you can use the tablename.fieldname syntax for referencing specific fields in specific tables (to avoid name conflicts)
- what happens when you do a join with no ON clause? 
	- you get back alll the possible combinations of rows (the cross product)
- identing and lines are irrelevant in SQL
- you can use ```AND``` or ```OR``` in your ```ON``` clause to get more flexible JOIN results
- in DBS you "reconstruct replication" but you don't "store replication"

####*Video 3.5 - Multi-table Tracks Demo**

**A. Notes**

- we're going to work on XML to database
- iTunes is stored internally as an XML implementation of dictionaries
- you can combine a UNIQUE declaration and an ```INSERT OR IGNORE```` statement to deal with data that might not be unique
- you could, alternatively, use an ```INSERT OR REPLACE``` statement to say "if the thing already exists, then update it"
- Python None will get mapped to NULL in the DB
