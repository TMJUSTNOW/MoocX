<center> <h3>---------------------------------------</h3> </center>

####*Video 6.1 - JavaScript Object Notation (JSON!)*

**A. Notes**

- XML is a great serialization format for documents (similar to HTML)
- JSON is a cleaned-up version of how you describe a list in Python
    - it sure looks like Python!
- Douglas Crockford --> "Javascript: the good parts"
- JSON not is not as self-describing
- two structures:
    - list (array)
    - dictionary (key-value pairs)
- summing up:
    - Python (lists, dictionaries)
    - JavaScript (arrays, dictionaries)
    - Java (arrays, hashmaps

**B. Diving In**

- we have JSON, time to deserialize it
- JSON is built into Python
    - use something ```mydata = json.loads(data_string)```
- the thing you get back in that statement IS A PYTHON DICTIONARY
- you get back a native Python data structure
- JSON lists are wrapped in []

####*Video 6.2 - BONUS: Douglas Crockford - Discovering JSON*

**A. Notes**

- JSON as an "inevitable format for data intended to be consumed by programs"
- JSON made, as simply as possible, "language independent"
    - struggling with this notion of getting data and "putting it on the wire"
- Crockford's thoughts on XML:
    - "you send a query to a database and get this XML thing back...and then you have to send another query to that!"
- there is no versioning for JSON
    - this is "its best feature"
    - it wants to be an "alphabet"
        - very uncommon to make up new letters
    - it isn't going to change
- "JSON will never change"

####*Video 6.3 - Service Oriented Approach*

**A. Notes**

- SOA = building meta-applications by building services using other services
- services publish the "rules" application must follow to make use of the services (API)

####*Video 6.4 - Service Oriented Architectures*

**A. Notes**

- providing a "service layer" lets users and applications interact with each other with a common data type in the middle
- researchers can work across institutions in "virtual organizations"

####*Video 6.5 - Accessing APIs in Python*

**A. Notes**

- API = "application programming interface"
    - a defined set of rules to interface with other applications
- REST - representational state transfer (resource focused)
    - remote resources which we create
    - more data-oriented
    - a pettern we use
 
**B. Google's Geocoding API**

- urllib has a ```urllib.urlencode()``` to translate natural text into a URL
- to pretty print, you can use ```json.dumps(js, indent=4)```
- there are rules for passing parameters to a URL....urllib.urlencode() will take care of all of that for us

**C. API Security and Rate Limiting**

- the compute resources to run these APIs are not "free"
- the rules can change!
- be respectful

####*Video 6.6 - API Security and Rate Limiting*

**A. Notes**

- limits:
    - 2500 requests per day

**B. Using the Twitter API**

- don't abuse Twitter...don't get yourself in trouble
- you have to run the API as yourself
    - hand Twitter the keys
    - OAUTH access tokens
- OAuth is used to send and verify signatures
- augment the url with all your authorization, then do a GET request
- Twitter will return a 'rate-limit-remaining' parameter

**C. A More Sophisticated App**

- body and headers come back as two seperate elements
- data in JSON, headers as a dictionary
- lots of "pretty print JSON" links online!!

**D. Summary**

- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) - allows an application to be broken into parts and distributed across a network
- an application program interface (API) is a contract for interaction between programs
- Web Services provide infrastructure for applications cooperating (an API) over a network - SOAP and REST are two styles
- XML and JSON are serializaiton formats
