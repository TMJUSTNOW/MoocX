####*Video 1.1.1 - Introduction: What and Why*

**A. Notes**

- Cecilia Aragon
- visualization = "presenting results in a way that makes sense to the human brain"

**B. What is Information Visualization?**

- the visual representation of info
- goals:
	- effective
	- clarity
	- integrity
	- stimulate viewer engagement
- categories:
	- information visualization (abstract information w/o position in space)
	- scientific visualization (display something w/ physical locaiton in space)
	- visual analytics (interactivity)

**B. Why is Visualization Importatn?**

- w/ large datasets, need an efficient way to understand a vast amount of data
- human visual system is highest-bandwidth channel to the human brain

####*Video 1.1.2 - Motivating Examples*

**A. Notes**

- the human brain is probably the best pattern-matching tool we have
- "graphs reveal data that statistics may not"
- see, for example, "Anscombe's Quartet"

####*Video 1.1.3 - Data Types & Definitions*

**A. Notes**

- in order to visualize data:
	- map data sets to visual attributes (also known as data encoding)
- data types:
	- nominal
	- ordinal
	- quantitative (interval vs. ratio)
- nominal:
	- labels
- ordinal:
	- food quality, bond ratings
- interval:
	- location of zero is arbitrary
	- dates, geometric points
- ratio:
	- zero is fixed
	- length, mass, counts, amounts
	
####*Video 1.1.4 - Mapping Data Types to Visual Attributes*

**A. Notes**

- Jacque Bertin --> "Semiology of Graphics"
- attributes:
	- position
	- size
	- value
	- texture
	- color
	- orientation
	- shape

**B. Bertin's Levels of Organization**

- attributes:
	- position [Nominal, Ordinal, Quantitative]
	- size [NOQ]
	- value [NOq]
	- texture [No]
	- color [N]
	- orientation [N]
	- shape [N]
- hierarchy of perceptual properties:
	- humans can most accurately detect position, length, angle/slope
	- least accurate at perceiving differences in volume, color, density
- You can incode ordinal and quantitative data in color (think gray scale)
- HOWEVER.... hue is normally perceived as unordered (encode nominal variables using color)

####*Video 1.1.5 - Data Types Exercies*

**A. Notes**

- a number can still be nominal...you have to ask "does < or > actually make sense?"

####*Video 1.1.6 - Data Types and Visual Mappings Exercises*

**A. Notes**

- see the Playfair diagrams
- see www.smartmoney.com/marketmap
	- market cap is mapped to the rectangle area
	- market sector is mapped to the rectangle's position
	- gain or loss (in earnings) is mapped to color hue
	- magnitude of gain or loss is mapped to color value
- complexity block diagrams:
	- map to color and size
- color hue = e.g. "red"
- color value  = e.g. "dark red"
- numbers switching across zero (positive and negative) could be considered nominal or ordinal

####*VIdeo 1.2.1 - Data Dimensions*

**A. Notes**

- see Maneesh Agrawala
- scatterplot is most common for bivariate data
- 3D plots are possible
	- or maybe you could display three dimensions using bubble size w/ a bubble scatterplot
	- but remember that area is not perceived as accurately as position
- two variables can map to points
- third variable must use color, size or shape
	- very large design space

**B. Mulitdimensional Data**

- How many dimensions can be represented in an image?
	- is there a perceptual limit?
- Bertin: "an image can only have three dimensions, and that barrier is impassable"

####*Video 1.2.2 - Effective Visual Encoding*

**A. Notes**

- huge design space for visual encoding (grows w/ data dimensions)
- consider the following in choosing mappings
- \textbf{Importance Ordering}:
	- encode the most important information in the most perceptually accurate way
- \textbf{Expressiveness}:
	- depict all the data, and only the data
- \textbf{Consistency}:
	- the properties of the image (visual attributes) should match the properties of the data
	
**B. Mackinlay's Expressiveness Criteria**

- a set of facts is expressible in a visual language if:
	- the sentences (i.e. the visualizations) in the language express all the facts in the set of data, and only the facts in the data
- e.g. color hue is a bad choice for ordinal or quant data
- length is interpreted as a quantitative value
- length of bar says something untrue about the data

**C. Consistency**

- the properties of the image (visual attributes) should match the properties of the data
- don't map 1D data to 2D or 3D representations!

####*Video 1.2.3 - Effective VIsual Encoding Exercise*

**A. Notes**

- choose the most perceptually accurate encodings for the most important variables

####*Video 1.2.4 - Design Criteria for Visual Encoding*

**A. Notes**

- effectiveness
- expressive = "depict all the data, and only the data"

**B. Increasing the Amount of Information Encoded by a Spatail Position**

- techniques:
	- composition
	- alignment
	- folding
	- recursion
	- overloading
	
**C. Composition**

- orthogonal placement of axes
- creates a 2d metric space

**D. Alignment**

- repetition of an axis at different position in the space
- e.g. a time series line chart above a time series bar chart

**E. Folding**

- continuation of an axis in an orthogonal dimensions

**F. Recursion**

- repeated subdivision of the same space

**G. Overloading**

- the reuse of the same space for different data

####*Video 1.3.1 - The Eye is Not a Camera*

**A. Thinking with our Eyes**

- 70% of body's sense receptors reside in our eyes
- "The eye and the visual cortex of the brain form a massively parallel processor that provides the highest-bandwidth channel into human cognitive centers"
- important to understand how visual perception works in order to effectively design visualization

**B. How the Eye Works**

- the eye is a "dynamic and ongoing construction project"
- attention is selective (filtering)
- cognitive process transform visual info into comprehensible info
- psychophysics: concerned with establishing quantitative relations between physical stimulation and perceptual events

**C. HOw to Use Perceptual Properties**

- Information visualization should cause what is meaningful to stand out

**D. Eyes vs. Cameras**

- cameras
	- good optics
	- single focus, white balance, exposure
	- "full image capture" (all photons captured at the same time with equal importance)
- eyes
	- relatively poor optics
	- constantly scanning (saccades)
	- constantly adjusting focus
	- constantly adapting (white balance, exposure)
	- mental reconstruction of image (sort of)
- color is relative:
	- we reconstruct things in a context-dependent way
- the eye does not perceive actual pixel 

####*Video 1.3.2 - Preattentive Processing*

**A. Notes**

- certain basiv visual properties are deteceted immediately by low-level visual system
- "pop out" vs. serial search
- if a decision takes a fixed amount of time regardless of the number of distractors, it is "preattentive"

**B. Preattentive Processing (cont.)**

- a limited set of visual properties are process preattentively
- this is important for design of visualizations
	- what can be perceived immediately?
	- which properties are good discriminators?
	- what can mislead viewers?
- color is preattentive
- form (curvature) is preattentive (but maybe slower)
- conjunction target generally cannot be detected preattentively
	- you can detect form or color preattentively, but not both
- detection of a slanted line in a sea of vertical lines is preattentive

**C. More on Preattentiveness**

- see [Healey (2005)](http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/PP/index.html)
- list of preattentive properties:
	- length
	- width
	- size
	- curvature
	- number
	- terminators
	- intersection
	- closure
	- color (hue)
	- intensity
	- flicker
	- direction of motion
	- binocular luster
	- stereoscopic depth
	- 3D depth cues
	- lighting direction
	
####*Video 1.3.3 - Estimating Magnitude*

**A. Notes**

- Stevens' Power Law:
	- we tend to underestimate area
	- we tend to REALLY underestimate volume
- J. Flannery guidelines for representing quantitative information with area
- relative magnitude estimation:
- best:
	- position (common scalle), position (non-aligned scale)
- mediocre:
	- length
	- slope
	- angle
- worst:
	- area
	- volume
	- color (hue/saturation/value)
	
**B. Conclusion**

- what is currently known about visual perception can aid the design process
- understanding low-level mechanisms of the visual processing system and using that knowledge can result in improved displays

####*Video 1.3.4 - Evaluating VIsualizations*

**A. Critiquing a Visualization**

- first, consider the purpose of the visualization and who the audience is
- next, ascertain your initial reaction (positive, negative, emotional?)
- next, examine it in detail (what works?)

**B. Over-arching Questions**

1. Is the design visually appealing/aesthetically pleasing?
2. Is it immediately understandable? If not, is it understandable after a short period of study?
3. Does it provide insight or understanding that was not obtainable with the original representation (text, table, etc)?
4. Does it provide insight or understanding better than some alternative visualization would? Or does it require excessive cognitive effort? WHat kind of visualization might have been better?
- a good visualization adds value over a textual representation
5. Does the visualization reveal trends, patterns, gaps, and/or outliers? Can the viewer make effective comparisons?
6. Does the visualization successfully highlight important information, while providing context for that information?
7. Does it distort the information? IF it transforms it in some way, is this misleading or helpfully simplifying?
8. Does it omit important information?
9. Is it memorable?
10. Does it use visual components propely?
	- that is, does it properly represent the data using lines, color, position, etc.?
	- does it transform nominal, interval, and quantitative information properly?
11. Does it use labels and legends appropriately?
