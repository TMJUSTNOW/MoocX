### Implications 

A type of statement of the form:

If A is true, then B is true. Where A and B are themselves statements.


```tex
\text{If A, then B} \\
\text{A} \rightarrow  \text{B}
```

An implication is a **compound statement**, where statement *A* is called **hypothesis** and statement *B* is called **conclusion**.

### First Proof

**Divisibility Definition**

```tex
\text{An integer m divides an integer n, and we write }\\
m | n \text{, if there exists an integer k so that } n =km \\
```


- A **proposition** is a true statement that has been proved by a valid argument.
- A **theorem** is a particularly significant proposition
- A **lemma** is a subsidiary proposition, or more informally, a helper proposition that is used in the proof of a theorem.
- A **corollary** is a proposition that follows almost immediately from a theorem.
- An **axiom** is a statement that is assumed to be true.

**Proposition 1:** Transitivity of Divisibility

```tex
\text{Let a, b and c be integers.} \\ \\
\text{If a|b and b|c, then a|c }
```

**Proof**

```tex
\text{ Since a | b, there exists an integer r so that ra = b.}\\ 
\text{Since b | c, there exists an integer s so that sb = c.}\\
\mbox{ }\\
\text{Substituting ra for b in the previous equation}\\
s(ra) = c\\
(sr)a = c\\
\mbox{ }\\
\text{Since }(s\times r) \text{ is an integer, we get: }\\
a|c
```
