## General Computer Science Resources

- [Open Source Society's Computer Science Curriculum](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)
- [Google Guide to Technical Development](https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.htm)

## Code Practice Problems

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - Nice in that it is not aimed at any particular language.
- [Coding Bat](http://codingbat.com/java) - Beginner to intermediate programming puzzles in Python and Java.
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) - Coding puzzles for all! Some cool tutorials too.

## Math Resources

- [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/) is excellent for Calculus and Linear Algebra.
- [Paul's Online Math Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) covers Calculus I-III. Also differential equations if that's what you're into.
- [Shea](https://github.com/sheaftw). I've been tutoring calculus, statistics and linear algebra for ~5 years. Feel free to ask me questions!

## Machine Learning Resources

- [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) uses R but is an excellent mathematical introduction to common models used in data science. Requires intermediate statistics and simple linear algebra (matrix manipulation).

## Awesome Books

- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) for pwning your interviewers when the time comes.
