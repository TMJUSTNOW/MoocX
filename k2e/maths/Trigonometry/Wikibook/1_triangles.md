# Similar, Congruent, Isosceles, and Equilateral

* Two triangles of different sizes can have exactly the same size angles as each other.

## Isosceles

* An isosceles triangle is a triangle with at least *two sides that are the same length*.

* A triangle with two sides of the same length is symmetric. The right and left sides are the same.

* It also has *two angles that are the same*.

## Equilateral

* An equilateral triangle is a triangle with all *three sides the same length*.

* An equilateral triangle is also an isosceles triangle.

* An equilateral triangle have *three identical angles*.

## Similar and Congruent

* Two triangles are *congruent* if they have the same *shape and size*.

* If two triangles don't have the same size but have the same shape, they are *similar*.

* All the equilateral triangles, though they come in different size, have the same shape, they are then similar to each other.
