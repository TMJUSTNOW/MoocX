# introduction

* Trigonometry is the study of the properties of triangles
	* *Tri* is ancient greek word for three,
	* *gon* means angle,
	* *metry* measurement.

* Knowing some facts about a triangle (ex: lengths of its sides) then using trigonometry help to find out others facts about it.
* We can find the angles if we know the lengths of its sides.
* We can find the lengths of two sides if we know the length of one side and two of the angles.

As a consquence the Ancient Greeks were able to use trigonometry to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Moon.


## starting learning trigonometry

* one of the first things we learn in trigonometry is how to calculate what the third angle is in a triangle.
	* ex: if we have two angle of 60°, we know the third is 60°, all the angles must be 180°

* if we have two lengths but don't know any angle, the third lengths has a range of possibilities.

* to calculate length we start out by examining a right-angled triangle. (meaning, one angle is 90°)

* in a right-angled triangle we can work out the length of the longest side if given the lengths of the two shorter sides.

* the formula of the relationship between lengths in a right-angled triangle a, b, c where c is the longest length  is :
	* a² + b² = c²

* We call it the pythagoras Theorem

* For the more complex triangles, we use what we learned with the right-angled triangle to figure out them.

* Trigonometry and trigonometric functions can also be used with more complex shapes such as squares, hexagon, circles and ellipses.

* The subtle mathematical relationships between the triangle, the circle, the sine wave, and the exponential curve can only be fully understood with a firm foundation in trigonometry.
