# Preface to Trigonometry

* this book covers elementatry trigonometry
* prerequisites are high school algebra and geometry
* this text has a more geometric feel to it than most current trigonometry texts (usually too much of an analytic emphasis.)
* mindset of this book: preparing students to use trigonometry as it is used in other courses. (e.g. engineering, physics.)
* in chapter 5 we use the free software Gnuplot to graph some functions. (see Appendix B for tutorial)
* a few exercices require the student to write his own computer program to solve some numerical computations problems.
