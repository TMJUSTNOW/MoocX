# 1. Right Triangle Trigonometry

* Trigonometry is the study of the relations between the sides and angles of triangles.
* Trigonometry come from the greek, meaning "measure of three angles".
* Trigonometry have been used since Ancient Egypt to study astronomy
* Trigonometry use extensively trigonometric functions.

## 1.1 Angles

* definitions from elementary geometry
	* An angle is *acute* if it is between 0° and 90°
	* An angle is *right* angle is it equals 90°
	* An angle is *obtuse* if it is between 90° and 180°.
	* An angle is a *straight angle* if it equals 180°.

* in elementary geometry angles are always considered to be positive and not larger than 360°.

* definitions of pairs of angles:
	* two acute angles are *complementary* if their sum equals 90°.
	* two angles between 0° and 180° are *supplementary* if their sum equals 180°.
	* two angles between 0° and 360° are *conjugate* (or *explementary*) if their sum equals 360°.

* The sum of angles in a triangle equals 180°.

* An isosceles triangle is a triangle with two sides of equal length.

* A right triangle has one of the angles being a right angle. (the two other angles are complementary angles)

* The Thales Theorem states..
