Keywords unlock interest. Consider what the audience wants:
- skills and experiences
- terminology
- tools and experience

Go to the MSA Career Placement Page. Review the job postings and descriptions.

Identify your own keyword skills. Make sure you identify job-related skills and transferable skills (soft skills: leadership, communication, teamwork, etc.). 

#### Transferable Skills

| Category      | Skills |
| ------------- | ------ |
| Communication | etc... |

The overlap of the skills that a company want and the skills that you have are the relevant skills.

What is most important is to think about the job that you want in the future, and then emphasize the skills in your work history that are relevant to that job.

#### Relevant Content Categories

- Contact Information: Current mailing address, phone number, email, url (optional). Only list one address and phone number.
- Professional Summary: Synopsis using keywords, snapshot to peak interest, tells what you can do, four to ten lines. Think of this as an abstract to a journal article. Any significant achievements that back up the info in the summary can be included.
- Education and Practicum
- Work Experience
- Skills
- Other Categories

**Professional Summary Formula**

1. Describe yourself (modifiers and noun + statement of skills)
2. State your objective (optional - can be general)
3. Add your accomplishments, experiences, abilities
4. Use keywords
