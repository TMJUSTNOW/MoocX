### Creating a Personal Profile for Employment

Your goal is to create something that is personal but professional. Do not copy language from somebody else's profile.

Think about hobbies and preferences that might make you stand out on a personal profile.

You have about 200 words (2-3 paragraphs) to write your profile.

#### Weak vs. Strong Profiles

- Provide specific details
- Language variety in sentences
- "Family's sideline business" vs. "Family's sideline *beekeeping* business
- As long as possible, given the space

#### Profile Creation Process

- Brainstorm
- Select relevant information: you cannot include everything, so make sure that what you select is relevant to what you would like to do
- Use the worksheet to help
- Create the profile: 3 paragraphs / 200 words
- Submit for review

#### Getting Started

- Chunk related information together
- Use just first name
- Write in the third person

#### Story

Try to make your profile tell a story, instead of just being sentences of details.

#### Proofreading

- Look for different issues at each stage
- Print profile OR increase "view" size
- Read profile out loud
- Read profile backwards, starting at the end.
