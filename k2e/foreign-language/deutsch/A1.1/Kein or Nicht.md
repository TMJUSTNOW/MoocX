### Kein and Nicht?

One of the first confusions you will encounter when learning the German language is: What’s the difference between **kein** and **nicht** and when should you use them? The problem arises because in English we just have one word that covers both: **not**. This means you now have to think about the context of the sentence as you say it and think about which German word you need to use. Over time you will instinctively know and you’ll be able to choose the correct word seamlessly.

### When to use “nicht”?

Okay, the quick answer is that **nicht** is used in any situation except in direct relation to a noun, then you use a form of **kein**. Therefore if it’s to do with actions or situations you should use **nicht**.

**Example sentences:**
Ich kann hier **nicht** parken. ⇨ I can’t park here.
Ich will **nicht** ins Kino gehen. ⇨ I don’t want to go to the cinema.
Ich habe **nicht** aufgeräumt. ⇨ I have not cleaned up.
Ich gehe **nicht** zur Arbeit. ⇨ I’m not going to work.

### When to use “kein”?

When you want to use **not** or **no** in relation to a **noun** you should use a form of **kein**. Simply **kein** is used in situations where **nicht ein** would otherwise occur.

**Example sentences:**
Ich habe **kein** **Sofa**. ⇨ I don’t have a sofa.
Ich mag **keinen** **Kaffee**. ⇨ I don’t like coffee.
Ich will **keine** **Äpfel**. ⇨ I don’t want any apples.
Ich kenne **keinen** guten **Zahnarzt**. ⇨ I don’t know any good dentists.

The different forms of **kein** follow the same rules as **ein** and are explained in our blog [“The indefinite Article in a negative Statement.”](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/2330/the-indefinite-article-in-a-negative-statement)

When you first use these it will be confusing, but do not worry, you will pick it up quite quickly and it will soon become instinctive.
