Hallo!Guten Tag! ðŸ™‚

We have covered [greetingsand few basic questions](http://www.mygermannotes.blogspot.in/2015/11/lesson-1-hallo.html), [counting](http://www.mygermannotes.blogspot.in/2015/11/counting-die-zahlen_16.html)and [alphabet](http://www.mygermannotes.blogspot.in/2015/12/spell-your-name-buchstabieren-sie-ihren.html).These are very basic things. Kindergarten level. [And by the way, Kindergartenis a German word. Kinder means children and Garten means garden.]

But aswe move to higher class, Grammar isintroduced. German, I believe, is pretty strict in terms of grammar. Duringschool time, I used to think that German is similar to Mathematics in terms ofscoring marks. In Mathematics, there is only one correct answer, like ways, inGerman there used to be only one correct answer. ðŸ˜€ Thereare various rules in Mathematics. In German too, there are various rules.

Anyway, coming backto German Grammar. Following are certain points that will be covered in greaterdetails later on:

- Articles: In German, every noun has an     article associated with it. These are:

- - Maskuline: der Vater (the father)
  - Feminine: die Mutter (the mother)
  - Neutral: das Kind (the child)
  - Plural: die Kinder (the children)      [Luckily all the plurals have article: die]

- Capitalization:     Following are     the rules for capitalization:

- - First letter of first word      in a sentence is capitalized. This is similar to English. For example, T (of this) in the previous      sentence is capitalized.
  - Each and every noun in      capitalized irrespective of its position in a sentence. This rule is not      similar to English. For example: Ich liebe meine Familie. I of ich is capitalized because it is the first letter of first word in      this sentence, while F of Familie is capitalized because it is a noun.
  - Names are capitalized. Ich heisse      Shruti Aggarwal.
  - Adjectives, pronouns (except Sie â€“ politer way of      addressing), verbs, prepositions and articles are not capitalized until      they are not the first word in the sentence.
  - The more youâ€™ll read, the      more youâ€™ll observe this. So keep reading!
