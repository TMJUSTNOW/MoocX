# Counting and Calculating in German from 0 to 1,000



For each number below, two forms are shown:

1. the **cardinal** number (*Kardinalzahl* - 1, 2, 3...) and
2. **ordinal** number (*Ordinalzahl* - 1st, 2nd, 3rd...)

In some cases the **fractional** number (*Bruchzahl* - 1/2, 1/5, 1/100...) is also given. (To make fractions [*Brüche*], just add -**tel** or -**el** to the number: **acht** + **el** = **achtel** [an eighth], **zehn** + **tel** = **zehntel** [a tenth].)

Although the masculine (calendar date) form is shown for the ordinal numbers, they can also be feminine (**die**), neuter (**das**) or plural, depending on the noun they are used with: **das erste Auto** (the first car), **die zweite Tür** (the second door), **die ersten Menschen** (the first humans), etc.

When referring to individual numbers in German, you say "die zwei" (2) or "die einundzwanzig" (21), short for "die Nummer/Zahl..." An example would be naming the winning numbers for the lottery on television.
