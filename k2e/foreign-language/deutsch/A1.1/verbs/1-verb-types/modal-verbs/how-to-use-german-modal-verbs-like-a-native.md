# How to use German Modal Verbs like a Native

### German Modal Verbs are key to the German Language

Modal verbs in German are part of the core language. It is important when learning German to get a good grasp of these verbs as they are used on a very regular basis. A modal verb modifies or emphasises the meaning of other verbs and is conjugated in an unusual way. In English this would be something like “should”, e.g. **I should play football** rather than **I play football**. There are 6 modal verbs in the German language.  Let’s take a closer look at them 🙂

 

When you use a modal verb in combination with a second verb then the second verb will go to the end of the sentence and will stay in the infinitive form.

### Examples

Ich will Fußball spielen. – I want to play football.
Er soll zu Hause bleiben. – He should stay at home.
Wir müssen nach Hause fahren. – We have to drive home.
Darfst du nach der Schule ins Kino gehen? – Are you allowed to go to cinema after school?
Leider kann ich dir nicht helfen. – Unfortunately I can’t help you.
Ich mag dich nicht danach fragen. – I dont want to ask you about it.

                    


        
        
            I’ve added an example for you 🙂

        

    


        
        
            Sie sind sehr nett:)

        

    


        
        
            Ich mag velofahren weil man dann draussen in der Natur ist und viel mehr sieht!

        

    


        
        
            In the example, you have ‘Ich mag dich nicht danach fragen’ translate as ‘I don’t want to ask you about it’. 
Why not use ‘Ich will dich nicht danach fragen’?

        

    


        
        
            @Simon: You could say both. Your sentence is correct too 🙂

        

    


        
        
            could you please tell me how to form compound nouns..

        

    


        
        
            is there no difference between du sollst and du solltest.

        

    


        
        
            @Aditya: A compound noun is a noun that is made up of two or more words. You just put them together. Here are some examples:
Hand (hand) + Tuch (towel) = Handtuch (hand towel)
Blumen (flowers) + Topf (pot) = Blumentopf (flower pot)
And “du sollst” is used more as an order or firm statement that you should do this. Whereas “du sollstest” is more of a suggestion about something you could do. For example:
Du sollst dein Zimmer aufräumen – You should clean your room.
Du solltest zum Arzt gehen – You should go to the doctor.
