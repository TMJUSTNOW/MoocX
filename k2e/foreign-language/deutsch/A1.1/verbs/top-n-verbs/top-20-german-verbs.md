### 20 most important German Verbs

Here is a list of what we thought are the 20 most commonly used German verbs. The ending of verbs can change depending on the subject pronoun that comes before the verb. We have shown you these different types of endings in our blogs  [ Weak Verbs](../880/how-german-verbs-work-in-the-present-tense-part-1.html) and [Strong Verbs](../924/how-german-verbs-work-in-the-present-tense-part-2.html) ðŸ™‚ You might also want to read our blog about [German Modal Verbs](../2966/how-to-use-german-modal-verbs-like-a-native.html).
