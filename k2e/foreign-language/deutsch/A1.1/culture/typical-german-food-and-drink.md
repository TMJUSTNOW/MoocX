## German Food and Drink

What is the first thing that pops into your head when you think about German food? Lots of sausage, beer and bread? Well yes, Germans love their cold meats, refreshing beers and freshly baked breads but there is actually a lot more to German cuisine than “sausage”. Did you know, for example, that in the afternoon most German people have coffee and cake?

They also enjoy a continental breakfast, which includes crusty rolls with either cheese, cold meat, jam or a chocolate spread. Cereal or Muesli with milk or yoghurt is another popular breakfast choice. Coffee, tea or juice is a welcome beverage in the mornings.

Lunches and dinners vary in Germany as every county has its own specialities. Let’s have a closer look:

### Baden-Württemberg

- Maultaschen ⇨ pasta filled with various ingredients, for example meat, spinach or onions
