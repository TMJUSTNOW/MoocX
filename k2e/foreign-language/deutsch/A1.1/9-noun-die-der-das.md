Hallo!Wie geht‚Äôs? üôÇ 

Was ist ein nomen (What is a noun?)
A noun can either be
- a place. eg.die Stadt (the city), das Dorf (the village)
- a person eg. die Frau (the woman), 
- the thing eg. der Computer (the computer)
- idea eg. die Gesundheit (the health)

Look around.. Whatdo you see? A television or a laptop? A book? So many things, right? All ofthese are nouns (obviously!!). In German, each noun has an article associatedwith it, which is one of the following:

- der (Masculine): der     Bleistift
- die (Feminine): die Vase
- das (Neutral): das Kinder, das M√§dchen
- die (Plural): die     Bleistifte, die Vasen, die Kinder. Irrespective of the fact whether that noun is     masculine, feminine or neutral in its singular form, its article changes     to die in     its plural form.

> Notice that das M√§dchen is neutral, but that is a girl. The reason for that is ending with "chen". In german, if something ends with  "chen", it means small generally. eg. das Br√∂tchen, i.e. small bread.

It is recommended to learn every new word in German with its definite article. One must learn thearticles well. Though there is generally no logic to it [I mean who has decided that Bleistift (pencil) is masculine? My Bleistift is very beautiful and it hasgot a floral print on it. But it still remains masculine. :D].
