## Two way Dative Prepositions 

If you want to speak German, you'll have to know your dative prepositions. Many dative prepositions are common vocabulary in German, such as *nach** *(after, to), *von* (by, of) and *mit* (with). It's hard to speak without them. 

Simply put, dative prepositions are governed by the dative case. That is, they are followed by a noun or take an object in the dative case. 

In English, prepositions take the objective case (object of the preposition) and all prepositions take the same case.

In German, prepositions come in several "flavors," only one of which is dative.

There are two kinds of dative prepositions:

1. Those that are always dative and never anything else.
2. Certain [two-way or dual prepositions](https://www.thoughtco.com/two-way-doubtful-prepositions-in-german-1444444) that can be either dative or accusative — depending on how they are used.

### Examples

In the German-English examples below, the dative preposition is bolded. The object of the preposition is italicized.

- **Mit** *der Bahn* fahren wir. (We're going **by** *train*.)
- *Meiner Meinung* **nach** ist es zu teuer. **(In** *my opinion* it's too expensive.)
- Das Hotel ist *dem Bahnhof* **gegenüber.** (The hotel is **across from** *the train station.)*
- Er arbeitet **bei** *einer großen Firma.* (He works **at** *a big company*.)
- Wir verbringen eine Woche **am** *See*. (We're spending a week **at** *the lake*.)

Notice in the second and third examples above that the object comes before the preposition (with *gegenüber* this is optional.) Some German prepositions use this reverse word order, but the object must still be in the correct case.
