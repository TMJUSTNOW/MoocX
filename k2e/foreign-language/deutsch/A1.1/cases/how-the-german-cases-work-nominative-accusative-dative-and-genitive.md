### The German Cases

Right, let’s get stuck into the heart of the German language, the cases. There are four cases in the German language: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive. The cases are an important part of German grammar as they are responsible for the endings of [adjectives](../810/how-to-use-german-adjectives.html), [indefinite articles](../2333/the-indefinite-article.html) and when to use which [personal pronoun](../889/how-german-personal-pronouns-change-with-case.html). Let’s have a closer look below. Learn and enjoy the German language with Jabbalab! 🙂

 

### The Nominative Case

Indefinite Articleein Manneine Frauein HausThe nominative case is used for a person, animal or thing which is doing the action. In this case, you will be able to ask: Who/What did or is something? The nominative case is always used after the verbs sein and werden.Example sentences:Der Mann schläft. ⇨ Who sleeps?Die Frau kocht. ⇨ Who cooks?Es ist ein schönes Haus. ⇨ What is beautiful? The Accusative CaseMasculineFeminineNeutral
Example sentences:

Die Frau kocht. ⇨ Who cooks?

The accusative is also used after certain [prepositions](../768/how-to-use-german-prepositions.html).Example sentences:Ich sehe den Mann. ⇨ What do I see?Wir haben die Torte gegessen. ⇨ What have we eaten?Er hat ein Foto gemacht. ⇨ What has he made?You can see that the noun in the sentence here is always directly affected by the verb. The Dative CaseMasculineFeminineNeutral
Example sentences:

You can see that the noun in the sentence here is always directly affected by the verb.

An indirect object is a person, animal or a thing the action is intended to benefit or harm. You are able to ask: Who to/for or to/for what? In most situations you can also ask whom. The dative case is also used after certain [prepositions](../768/how-to-use-german-prepositions.html).Example sentences:Ich gab der Frau einen Apfel. ⇨ Who did I give an Apple to?Er hilft dem Mann beim Putzen. ⇨ Whom did he help to clean?Er gibt einem Mädchen einen Kuss. ⇨ Who did he give a kiss to? The Genitive CaseMasculineFeminineNeutral

The genitive case is used to show, that something belongs to someone. You’re able to ask: Whose…? The genitive case is also used after certain [prepositions](../768/how-to-use-german-prepositions.html).

Note:

–s is added to masculine and neuter nouns ending in: en, el or er.

e.g. der Lehrer → des Lehrers

e.g. der Geldbeutel → des Geldbeutels

e.g. das Eisen → des Eisens  

–es is added to the most masculine and neuter nouns of one syllable ending in a consonant.

e.g. der Mann → des Mannes

e.g. das Pferd → des Pferdes
Example sentences:

Das Haus der Frau ist blau. ⇨ Whose house is blue?

Das Auto des Mannes ist schwarz. ⇨ Whose car is black?

Das Hufeisen des Pferdes ist kaputt. ⇨ Whose horseshoe is broken?

Die Farbe des Geldbeutels ist braun. ⇨ Whose colour is brown?

Das Auto des Lehrers ist grün. ⇨ Whose car is green?

Die Tasche des Mädchens ist gelb. ⇨ Whose bag is yellow?

Das ist die Telefonnummer einer Freundin. ⇨ Whose telephone number is that?

                    


        
        
            Beautiful. You have made it simple. Thanks.

        

    


        
        
            Very useful and easy to internalize.

        

    


        
        
            The explanation is very good, thank you.  My English is bad and I don’t know why I want to learn German, I just love the language and find the nouns very easy to remember it’s just to make the sentence then… ok to write, but to speak – and they are so quick.

            Great, very clear, easy to understand, had no idea of cases and this completely cleared any misunderstanding. Many Thanks

        

    


        
        
            Finally a clear explanation! It would be nice too have the plural too.

        

    


        
        
            Heartily appreciated explanation!

        

    


please note that for the Accusative case the question can be ‘whom’ as well.
Ich sehe Eric (I see Eric). – Whom do I see?



me again..
to show you how tricky the distinction between dative and accusative is, I will turn one given example from dative into accusative:
“Er gibt dem Mädchen einen Kuss.” (he gives the girl a kiss) = dative (girl)
“Er küsst das mädchen” (he kisses the girl) = accusative (girl)
by the way: in the first sentence “a kiss” is the accusative

            After reading ein paar blog posts on German cases, I couldn’t understand shit about the usage. But this is really an eye opener on when to use the cases. I always wonder why Die Monate des Jahres is “The Month of the year” aber jetzt ich warum wissen. Vielen Dank.

        

    


        
        
            Sehr schön

            Yes much easier to understand, love the explanation 

        

    


        
        
            Kudos for the pedagogic expertise here, not even Institut Goethe’s materials are as clear.
