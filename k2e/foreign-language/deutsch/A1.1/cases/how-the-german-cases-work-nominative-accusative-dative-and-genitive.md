# How the German Cases work – Nominative, Accusative, Dative and Genitive

### The German Cases OR Fälle

Right, let’s get stuck into the heart of the German language, the cases. There are four cases in the German language: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive. The cases are an important part of German grammar as they are responsible for the endings of [adjectives](../810/how-to-use-german-adjectives.html), [indefinite articles](../2333/the-indefinite-article.html) and when to use which [personal pronoun](../889/how-german-personal-pronouns-change-with-case.html). 

 Andere Sprachen haben auch Fälle - Other languages have cases too.

Russian has 6 cases, Finish has 15 cases, Arabic has cases too. English used to have cases in past, but it has lost it over the time.

### Definition

From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case)

**Case** is a special [grammatical category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_category) of a [noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun), [pronoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun), [adjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective), [participle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participle) or [numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_(linguistics)) whose value reflects the [grammatical function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_function) performed by that word in a [phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase), [clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause), or [sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)). 

German has four cases. A case may determine the particular adjective, adjective ending, pronoun, and noun ending to use. If there is a definite article, the case is often easier to recognise. Here are the cases:

1. Nominative
2. Akkusative
3. Dative
4. Genetive

### Subject and Direct Object

**What is the subject of a sentence?**
The **subject** of a sentence is the person or thing that is “doing” the verb. To find the subject, look for the verb and ask “Who or what is doing?” (substitute the verb for “doing” -- Who or what is singing? Who or what is sleeping?) Subjects are always in the NOMINATIVE CASE.

**What is the direct object of a sentence?**
The **direct object** receives the action of the verb. To find the direct object, look for the verb and ask “Who or what is being verbed?” (as in Who or what is being kicked? Who or what is being read?) Direct objects take the ACCUSATIVE CASE.

Lets see the example.

Der Hund beißt **den Mann**.  - The dog bites the man.

Note that der Mann is changed to den Mann, as the man is the direct object here, which is being bitten by dog, and the dog is subject.

In english, there is no change in the article.

Also, in German, this sentence is also correct:

**Den Mann** beißt der Hund - The dog bites the man. 

We have just changed the article.



For example:

Eg. 1 - The woman sees the girl.

*The woman* is the subject and is nominative. *the girl* is the direct object and is accusative.

Eg. 2 - The girl sees the woman.

*The girl* is the subject and is nominative. *the woman* is the direct object and is accusative.

George W. Bush is the President.*George W. Bush* is the subject and is nominative. *the President* is ALSO nominative because it follows “to be” (is).

### The Nominative Case

|                        | Masculine | Feminine  | Neutral  |
| ---------------------- | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| **Definite Article**   | der Mann  | die Frau  | das Haus |
| **Indefinite Article** | ein Mann  | eine Frau | ein Haus |

The nominative case is used for a person, animal or thing which is doing the action. In this case, you will be able to ask: **Who/What** did or is something? The nominative case is always used after the verbs **sein** and **werden.**

**Example sentences:**

Der Mann schläft. ⇨ **Who** sleeps?

Die Frau kocht. ⇨ **Who** cooks?

Es ist ein schönes Haus. ⇨ **What** is beautiful?

 

### The Accusative Case

|                        | Masculine  | Feminine  | Neutral  |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------- | -------- |
| **Definite Article**   | den Mann   | die Frau  | das Haus |
| **Indefinite Article** | einen Mann | eine Frau | ein Haus |

The accusative case is used for a person, animal or thing which is **directly** affected by the action of the verb. The accusative is also used after certain [prepositions](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/768/how-to-use-german-prepositions).

**Example sentences:**

Ich sehe den Mann. ⇨ What do I see?

Wir haben die Torte gegessen. ⇨ What have we eaten?

Er hat ein Foto gemacht. ⇨ What has he made?

You can see that the noun in the sentence here is always directly affected by the verb.

 

### The Dative Case

|                        | Masculine  | Feminine   | Neutral    |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Definite Article**   | dem Mann   | der Frau   | dem Haus   |
| **Indefinite Article** | einem Mann | einer Frau | einem Haus |

The dative case is used to show the **indirect** object of a verb. An indirect object is a person, animal or a thing the action is intended to benefit or harm. You are able to ask: **Who to/for** or **to/****for what?** In most situations you can also ask **whom**. The dative case is also used after certain [prepositions](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/768/how-to-use-german-prepositions).

**Example sentences:**

Ich gab der Frau einen Apfel. ⇨ **Who** did I give an Apple **to**?

Er hilft dem Mann beim Putzen. ⇨ **Whom** did he help to clean?

Er gibt einem Mädchen einen Kuss. ⇨ **Who** did he give a kiss **to**?

 

### The Genitive Case

|                        | Masculine     | Feminine   | Neutral        |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| **Definite Article**   | des Mannes    | der Frau   | des Hauses     |
| **Indefinite Article** | eines Mannes  | einer Frau | eines Hauses   |
| ****                   | des Lehrers   |            | des Mädchens   |
| ****                   | eines Lehrers |            | eines Mädchens |

The genitive case is used to show, that something belongs to someone. You’re able to ask: **Whose…?** The genitive case is also used after certain [prepositions](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/768/how-to-use-german-prepositions).

**Note:**

–**s** is added to masculine and neuter nouns ending in: **en**, **el **or **er**.

e.g. der Lehrer → des Lehrer**s**

e.g. der Geldbeutel → des Geldbeutel**s**

e.g. das Eisen → des Eisen**s**

–**es** is added to the most masculine and neuter nouns of one syllable ending in a consonant.

e.g. der Mann → des Mann**es**

e.g. das Pferd → des Pferd**es**

**Example sentences:**

Das Haus der Frau ist blau. ⇨ **Whose** house is blue?

Das Auto des Mann**es** ist schwarz. ⇨ **Whose** car is black?

Das Hufeisen des Pferd**es** ist kaputt. ⇨ **Whose** horseshoe is broken?
