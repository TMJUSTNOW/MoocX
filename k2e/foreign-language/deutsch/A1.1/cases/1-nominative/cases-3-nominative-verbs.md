## Der Nominativ Verben (The nominative verbs)

Here are the points to keep in mind:

1. Das Subjekt des Setzes - The nominative is the subject of the sentence.
2. Auch benutzt nach den Verben - Also used after these verbs:
   bleiben (to stay) , sein(to be), werden (to become..note that bekommen means to get), heißen(to be called or to mean something), scheinen (to appear)

### What does point 2 means

**Every verb uses a nominative complement. **

A complement is a necessary element in the sentence - i.e. a subject and direct object.

**Because there always has to be an acting person or thing (Nominative = Subject = acting person/thing ). Most of the verbs use more than one complement. The verbs "sein", "werden", "bleiben", "heißen" and "scheinen" use a 2nd nominative complement in addition to the subject.**

Lets see the example

**Das** ist **eine Gurke**. - That is a cucumber.

Das - subject

eine Gurke - predicative noun

**Both subject and predicative noun are Nominative.**

ist - conjugated form of sein

### Why both are Nominative?

Both are nominative as both are pointing to the same subject - a cucumber.

For e.g..

Ich kaufe eine Gurke - I buy a cucumber.

Here there is a difference - I i.e. me as subject, is affecting cucumber - and hence it is a direct object as it is being affected by my action.

### More Example

sein( to be ) - Das ist eine schönes Haus - That is a beautiful house

bleiben(to stay) - Thomas bleibt mein bester Freund - Thomas stays my best friend.

werden(to become) - Sie will eine reiche Ärztin werden - She wants to become a rich doctor.

heißen (to be called or mean) - Das heißt süßer Apfel auf Deutsch. - This means the sweet apple from Germany.

scheinen (to seem) - Er scheint ein guter Chef zu sein. - He seems to be a nice boss.

as it is der Chef - gut becomes guter

### Summary

**Nominative**

   • for the **subject** of a sentence: who or what is doing this?

​	**Der Student** lernt Deutsch. 

   • for **predicate nouns**: when the main verb is *sein* or *werden*, use the nominative for both subject and predicate nouns.

​	**Das** ist **ein Tisch**.

​	**Nominative** Verb **Nominative**
