## Possessive Pronouns in Genetive



You just need to add an 'es' to the end of the masculine possessive pronoun, an 'er' to the end of the feminine one and an 'es' again to the end of the neuter one.

| Masculine | Feminine | Neuter  | English translation               |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| meines    | meiner   | meines  | my                                |
| deines    | deiner   | deines  | your (informal singular)          |
| seines    | seiner   | seines  | his                               |
| ihres     | ihrer    | ihres   | her                               |
| seines    | seiner   | seines  | its                               |
| unseres   | unserer  | unseres | our                               |
| eures     | eurer    | eures   | your (informal plural)            |
| Ihres     | Ihrer    | Ihres   | your (formal singular and plural) |
| ihres     | ihrer    | ihres   | their                             |

**Masculine noun example:**

Die Freundin meines Sohnes (My son's girlfriend). 'My son' is in this case as he 'possesses' the girlfriend. Notice the additional -es at the end of 'Sohn'.

**Feminine noun example:**

Die Handtasche deiner Mutter (Your mother's handbag). 'Your mother' is in this case as she possesses the handbag.

**Neuter noun example:**

Ein Teil unseres Hauses (A part of our house). 'Our house' is in this case as it possesses the part. Notice the additional -es at the end of 'Haus'.

Notice how in all three of these tables the possesser always follows that which is possessed.

Only when using the possessive form of a person's name or a thing, should you add an 's' as we do to English, just without an apostrophe. For example:

Clares Buch - Clare's book.
