# How the German Cases work – Nominative, Accusative, Dative and Genitive

### The German Cases OR Fälle

Right, let’s get stuck into the heart of the German language, the cases. There are four cases in the German language: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive. The cases are an important part of German grammar as they are responsible for the endings of [adjectives](../810/how-to-use-german-adjectives.html), [indefinite articles](../2333/the-indefinite-article.html) and when to use which [personal pronoun](../889/how-german-personal-pronouns-change-with-case.html). 

 Andere Sprachen haben auch Fälle - Other languages have cases too.

Russian has 6 cases, Finish has 15 cases, Arabic has cases too. English used to have cases in past, but it has lost it over the time.

### Definition

From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case)

**Case** is a special [grammatical category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_category) of a [noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun), [pronoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun), [adjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective), [participle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participle) or [numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_(linguistics)) whose value reflects the [grammatical function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_function) performed by that word in a [phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase), [clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause), or [sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)). 

German has four cases. A case may determine the particular adjective, adjective ending, pronoun, and noun ending to use. If there is a definite article, the case is often easier to recognise. Here are the cases:

1. Nominative
2. Akkusative
3. Dative
4. Genetive

### Subject and Direct Object

**What is the subject of a sentence?**
The **subject** of a sentence is the person or thing that is “doing” the verb. To find the subject, look for the verb and ask “Who or what is doing?” (substitute the verb for “doing” -- Who or what is singing? Who or what is sleeping?) Subjects are always in the NOMINATIVE CASE.

**What is the direct object of a sentence?**
The **direct object** receives the action of the verb. To find the direct object, look for the verb and ask “Who or what is being verbed?” (as in Who or what is being kicked? Who or what is being read?) Direct objects take the ACCUSATIVE CASE.

**What is the indirect object of a sentence?**

The indirect object is often the receiver of the direct object or somehow indirectly affected via subject.

#### Example 1

Lets see the example.

Der Hund beißt **den Mann**.  - The dog bites the man.

Note that der Mann is changed to den Mann, as the man is the direct object here, which is being bitten by dog, and the dog is subject.

In english, there is no change in the article.

Also, in German, this sentence is also correct:

**Den Mann** beißt der Hund - The dog bites the man. 

We have just changed the article.

#### Example 2

Eg. 1 - The woman sees the girl.

*The woman* is the subject and is nominative. *the girl* is the direct object and is accusative.

Eg. 2 - The girl sees the woman.

*The girl* is the subject and is nominative. *the woman* is the direct object and is accusative.

George W. Bush is the President.*George W. Bush* is the subject and is nominative. *the President* is ALSO nominative because it follows “to be” (is).

#### Example 3 - Sentence with all the cases

Eg. Sentence with all the cases - Ich gebe dem Mann das Buch meines Vaters. - I give my father's book to the man.

- Ich - Nominative as Ich is subject
- dem Mann - Dative as it is Indirect Object (One way to see it has indirect as it has preposition "to" though this is not always true.)
- das Buch - Accusative as it is direct object
- meines Vaters - Genitive as it tells whose book it is.

| Case       | English                         | Deutsch                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Nominative | Who or what is doing something? | Wer oder was macht etwas? |
| Accusative | Who is directly affected?       | Wen?                      |
| Dative     | Who is indirectly affected?     | Wem?                      |
| Genetive   | Whose                           | Wessen?                   |
