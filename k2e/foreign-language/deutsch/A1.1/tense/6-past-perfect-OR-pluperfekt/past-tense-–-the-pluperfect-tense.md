### German Pluperfect Tense

Previously we introduced you to some German past tense forms like the [perfect tense](../1011/past-tense-german-how-to-talk-about-the-past-in-german.html) and the [imperfect tense](../1028/past-tense-german-the-imperfect-tense.html). In this article we will be looking at the pluperfect tense.
The pluperfect tense sounds complicated but is actually pretty straight forward.

### When to use the pluperfect tense?

The pluperfect tense is used to describe something that had happened or had been true at some point in the past. In English, you will see the pluperfect used in sentences with a form like “I had gone” or “you’d given”.

For example:
He had come home late. ⇨ Er war spät nach Hause gekommen.
We had forgotten his birthday. ⇨ Wir hatten seinen Geburtstag vergessen.

### Forming a sentence in the pluperfect tense

The pluperfect tense is formed in a similar way to the perfect tense in that it has two parts:

- The first part is the imperfect tense of either [haben](../1567/the-german-verb-haben-to-have.html) or [sein](../1480/the-german-verb-sein-to-be.html).

- The second part is the past participle.

Some verbs are built with sein and others with haben. Which verb to use follows the same rule we discussed in our [perfect tense](../1011/past-tense-german-how-to-talk-about-the-past-in-german.html) post. The majority of German past tense sentences are constructed using the verb haben, however when talking about something movement related, you would use the verb sein.
