## The Imperative Mood

The imperative mood is used for commands and instructions. It can only occur in the second person, so we just need to learn three main forms: *du* (informal singular), *ihr* (informal plural), and *Sie* (formal singular & plural). The *du *form is just the present tense *du* form without the *st* ending:

| gebento give  | -->  | du gibst 2nd person singular  | -->  | **Gib** mir das! **Give** me that!       |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
|               |      |                               |      |                                          |
| nehmento take | -->  | du nimmst 2nd person singular | -->  | **Nimm** die Schlüssel mit. **Take**the keys with you. |

The *ihr *form is identical to the present tense:[examples]Finally, the *Sie *form is also the same as the present tense, but the *Sie* is included after the verb. There can be a slight tension between the respectful tone of *Sie* and the fact that you’re giving an order, so this is often softened with *bitte* (please) – and in practice it’s used mainly for polite requests, not outright commands.

**\*Nehmen Sie bitte** eine Broschüre.* Please take a brochure.

The verb 

sein

 is irregular in the imperative, based on the infinitive instead of the conjugated stems:

| "du" form: **Sei** still! Be quiet! | "ihr" form: **Seid** brav, Kinder. Be good, kids. | "Sie" form: **Seien Sie** bitte geduldig... Please be patient... |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|                                     |                                          |                                          |

That's it for the conjugated imperative forms, but there are two related forms you should be aware of. The first is the "infinitive imperative," which is common in posted rules and regulations. When it's used in speech, it usually has a sharper "drill sergeant" tone than the forms above. You probably won't use the infinitive this way yourself, but you should be able to recognize it. Unlike "true" imperative statements where the verb comes at the beginning (as in all the examples above), when you use the infinitive this way it comes at the end:

*Hinten \**Anstellen**!* Go to the back! [of a line]

*Nicht mit dem Fahrer \**sprechen**!* Don't speak to the driver!

And finally, there's a "friendly suggestion" formation in German that's equivalent to "Let's..." in English. It's the same as the normal "wir" present tense form, you just switch the order of the verb and pronoun:

*Lass uns zur Seitentür \**reingehen**.* Let's go in the side door.
