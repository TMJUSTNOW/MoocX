## The Perfect Tenses

Once you know a verb’s participle, the *Perfekt* is formed by adding it to the present tense of *haben* or *sein*:

| **haben:**                               | **sein:**                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| *Ich habe gelacht.*I laughed.            | *Du bist aber gewachsen!*Have you ever grown! |
| *Es hat funktioniert.*It worked.         | *Wir sind wieder zu Hause angekommen.*We arrived back home. |
| *Habt ihr gegessen?*Have you (guys) eaten? | *Sind sie da geblieben?*Did they stay there? |

Your first instinct will be to translate every *Perfekt* statement in German with the perfect tense in English: "I have laughed," "It has worked," etc. But as you can see above, the most natural translation is usually the simple past (preterite) tense. There is effectively **no connection**between the *Präteritum*/*Perfekt* distinction in modern German, which is mainly a written/spoken one, and the preterite/perfect distinction in English, which is about the relationship between past and present (see the [next section](http://germanforenglishspeakers.com/v-verbs/6-perfect-vs-preterite/) for much more on this).

Most verbs take *haben*, but some of the ones that take *sein* are pretty common. In general, *sein *is for verbs showing a change of location (movement) or a change of state/condition (transformation). For example:

| **movement:***gehen* – to go*kommen* – to come*laufen* – to walk, run | **change of state:***sterben* – to die*wachsen* – to grow*genesen* – to recover, convalesce |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|                                          |                                          |

There are some regional differences; generally, as you go further South you'll hear more verbs used with *sein*. For example, in Bavaria it's more common to say *ich bin gesessen* (I was sitting) but in the rest of Germany it's *ich habe gesessen*.

Verbs that take *sein* are always **intransitive**, which means that they don't take a direct (accusative) object. Unfortunately, many intransitive verbs also take *haben*, like *schlafen* (to sleep) or *starren* (to stare), so this rule doesn't work in the other direction.

In the rare cases where a *sein *verb is used with a direct object, it takes *haben *instead:

| **intransitive** (*sein*):*Ich \**bin** in die Stadt gefahren.*I drove into the city. | **transitive** (*haben*):*Ich \**habe** meine Schwester in die Stadt gefahren.*I drove my sister into the city. |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|                                          |                                          |

However, it’s more common for verbs to have a transitive variant: one example that still has the shift in English is *fallen* (with *sein*, as in "a tree **falls**") vs. *fällen* (with *haben*, as in "to **fell**a tree").  Another is *liegen/legen*, which corresponds to the English "lie/lay." With pairs like these in German, the transitive verb (with *haben*) tends to be weak, while the intransitive verb (with *sein*) is strong.

The *Plusquamperfekt* is used for an event that had already occurred before some other point in the past. It’s the same as the *Perfekt*, only it uses the past tense (*Präteritum*) of *haben/sein*instead of the present tense:

*Es \**hatte** bereits **angefangen** zu regnen, als Stefan nach Hause kam.*
It **had** already **started** to rain when Stefan came home.

*Wir \**waren** bis zur Brücke **gekommen**, bevor uns einfiel, dass wir unser Geld**vergessen hatten**.*
We **had come** to the bridge before it occurred to us that we **had forgotten** our money.

*Damals \**hatten** wir noch nie ein echtes Schloss **gesehen**.*
At the time, we **had** never **seen** a real castle before.

One of the more complex aspects of the perfect tenses in German is what to do when there are multiple verbs in a dependent clause. Generally, German does not allow two adjacent past participles in the same clause. Instead, both become infinitives. (There is an exception to this, termed the [Ultra-Perfekt](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppeltes_Perfekt) by some, but it’s regional and very non-standard usage.) And when such a bundle of verbs gets grouped together at the end of a dependent clause, the conjugated auxiliary verb goes before the infinitive forms, not after them.

*Ich habe es gemacht.* (I did it.)
*Ich musste es machen.* (I had to do it.)
*Ich habe es machen müssen.* (I had to do it.)
*Weißt du, bis wann er es hatte machen müssen?* (Do you know by when he had to have done it?)
