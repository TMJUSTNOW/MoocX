## Perfect vs. Preterite

In English we use the preterite about 90% of the time, and we tend to reserve the perfect for situations where a past action has ongoing implications or relevance in the present. For example, consider "**have you seen** the Godfather movies?" (perfect – if you haven’t, you still could) versus "**did you see** the circus while it was in town?" (preterite – it’s too late to see it now).

In German, this distinction no longer really exists. There is a single concept of the past (*die Vergangenheit*) and **the Präteritum and Perfekt tenses are interchangeable **in expressing it. In practice, Germans use the *Perfekt* for about 90% of speech; they only use the *Präteritum* in speech for the auxiliary and modal verbs and a few *very* common strong or mixed verbs. Overusing the *Präteritum* in speech will make you sound like a snob or a robot, depending on the context.

Here are the rules you should follow in *spoken* German:

\1. Always use the preterite for *sein*:

| *Ich \**war** glücklich.*I was happy.   | *Es \**war** schönes Wetter auf der Insel.*The weather on the island was nice. |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **\*Warst** du zu Hause?*Were you home? | *Wir \**waren** noch nie in Griechenland.*We've never been to Greece. |

\2. Always use the preterite for modal verbs:

| *Ich \**konnte** es nicht sehen.*I couldn't see it. | *Das \**solltest** du schon gestern machen.*You were supposed to do that yesterday. |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **\*Durfte** er nicht mitkommen?*Wasn't he allowed to come along? | *Wir \**wollten** aber nicht.*But we didn't want to. |

\3. Use the perfect tense for everything else:

| *Ich \**bin** ihm am Sonntag **begegnet**.*I met him on Sunday. | *Was \**hast** du ihm **gesagt**?*What did you say to him? |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| *Es \**ist** vor langer Zeit **gemacht worden**.*It was done a long time ago. |                                          |
| *Meine Vorfahren \**haben** Deutschland vor 150 Jahren **verlassen**.*My ancestors left Germany 150 years ago. |                                          |

You'll hear native speakers using more exceptions than these, of course, but they tend to be verb-by-verb (and often regional) preferences that you have to just pick up by ear.

Written German always uses the *Präteritum* more than spoken German, but just how much varies according to the context. The *Präteritum* is most favored in novels, history and other literary/academic writing. For example, here's the opening of a detective novel by the German author Jakob Arjouni. We've highlighted all the conjugated verbs for you:

| *Endlich schlug ich die Augen auf und ortete die verdammte Fliege. Dick und schwarz saß sie auf der weißen Bettdecke. Ich zielte anständig und stand auf, um mir die Hand zu waschen. Den Spiegel mied ich. Ich ging in die Küche, setzte Wasser auf* und suchte Filtertüten. | Finally I opened my eyes and located the damned fly. Fat and black, it sat on the white blanket. I aimed well and stood up to wash my hand. I avoided the mirror. I wentinto the kitchen, set up some water [to boil] and looked for coffee filters. |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|                                          |                                          |

 

Präteritum

| **Strong Verbs**                         | *Präteritum*                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| *aufschlagen* (to open)*sitzen* (to sit)*aufstehen* (to stand up)*meiden* (to avoid)*gehen* (to go) | *schlug auf* (opened)*saß* (sat)*stand auf* (stood up)*mied* (avoided)*ging* (went) |
| **Weak Verbs**                           | *Präteritum*                             |
| *orten* (to locate)*zielen* (to aim)*aufsetzen* (to set)*suchen* (to look for) | *ortete* (located)*zielte* (aimed)*setzte auf* (set)*suchte* (looked for) |

Journalistic content generally leans towards the *Präteritum* too, although not quite as much. In fact, most news stories begin with either the *Präsens* or the *Perfekt* before switching back to the *Präteritum*. For [example](http://www.morgenpost.de/vermischtes/stars-und-promis/article116851748/Brad-Pitts-unanstaendiges-Geburtstagsgeschenk-fuer-Jolie.html):

| *Angelina Jolie hat mit Partner Brad Pitt in Berlin ihren 38. Geburtstag gefeiert. Dafür mieteten sie eine ganze Restaurant-Etage. Doch das Essen war nicht seine einzige Aufmerksamkeit...* | Angelina Jolie celebrated her 38th birthday with her partner Brad Pitt in Berlin. They rented an entire floor of a restaurant. But the food wasn't his only gift... |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|                                          |                                          |

This usage of the *Perfekt* is one of the few remaining echos in German of that "relevance to the present" distinction. It just sounds a little more up-to-the-minute, more like *news* to begin a story that way.

Once you get to less formal writing -- personal emails, online posts, text messages -- it's much harder to offer any clear guidelines. You will definitely see a lot more *Perfekt* in these formats than you would in a novel, often because we tend to affect a looser "spoken" register (in any language) in these kinds of casual writing. But there's also more use of the *Präteritum* than in speech. The exact mix of the two depends on the person and the context.

All students of German are told to avoid the *Präteritum* in speech, but few take it seriously enough. The fact is, many native speakers are unaware that certain preterite forms even *exist*in their language unless they've learned about them in advanced grammar classes. This is especially true of the second-person preterite forms, since books and newspapers are almost never written in the second person. For example, we know a teacher who was giving an English class to young [Deutsche Bahn](http://www.bahn.com/i/view/index.shtml) employees, and wanted them to come up with the phrase "what did you (guys) do?" in English. Instead of the normal "Was habt ihr gemacht?" (*Perfekt*) he asked them to translate "Was machtet ihr?" (*Präteritum*) so that they wouldn't have "what have you done?" as an option. But "Was machtet ihr?" sounds so odd to modern ears that the students absolutely refused to accept that it was proper German at all!
