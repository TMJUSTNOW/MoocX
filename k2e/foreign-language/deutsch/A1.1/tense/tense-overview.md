## Tense Overview

In German, tense is called zeiten which means time, so the word tempo is somtimes used (which comes from Latin). German tenses are very flexible.

### Tenses in English

To start with, here are some of the basic tenses and moods in English. Even if you’ve forgotten their names, the forms should look familiar:

| **TENSE**                      | **MOOD**             |                       |        |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------ |
| **Indicative**                 | **Conditional**      | **Imperative**        |        |
| **Present**                    | he does it           | he would do it        | Do it! |
| **Preterite**("simple past")   | he did it            | he would have done it |        |
| **Perfect**                    | he has done it       | he would have done it |        |
| **Past Perfect**(“pluperfect”) | he had done it       | he would have done it |        |
| **Future**                     | he will do it        |                       |        |
| **Future Perfect**             | he will have done it |                       |        |

### Tenses in German

And here are the tenses and moods in German. 

Present - Präsens

Past (or Vergangeheit) - Präteritum/Imperfekt, Perfekt

Beneath past - Plusquamperfekt (Similar to past perfect)

Future (Zukunft) - Futur I , Futur II

The statement is the same as above, using *er*(he), *es* (it), and the strong verb *tun *(to do):

| **TENSE**           | **MOOD**               |                           |                   |           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| **Indikativ**       | **Konjunktiv I**       | **Konjunktiv II**         | **Imperativ**     |           |
| **Präsens**         | Er tut es              | *Er tue es*               | Er würde es tun   | Tu(e) es! |
| **Präteritum**      | Er tat es              | *Er habe es getan*        | Er hätte es getan |           |
| **Perfekt**         | Er hat es getan        | *Er habe es getan*        | Er hätte es getan |           |
| **Plusquamperfekt** | Er hatte es getan      | *Er habe es getan*        |                   |           |
| **Futur I**         | Er wird es tun         | *Er werde es tun*         |                   |           |
| **Futur II**        | Er wird es getan haben | *Er werde es getan haben* |                   |           |

Be careful:** although most of the German tenses and moods look very much like their English counterparts, there are some big differences in how they're used.** In particular, the present and perfect tenses (*Präsens* and Perfekt) account for a huge proportion of actual German speech. The Perfekt is used for almost anything that happened in the past, and the Präsens is used for much of the future as well as the present. You still need to know the other four tenses, but they’re not used as often as their English equivalents.
