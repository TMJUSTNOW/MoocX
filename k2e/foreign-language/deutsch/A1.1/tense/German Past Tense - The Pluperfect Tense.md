### German Pluperfect Tense

Previously we introduced you to some German past tense forms like the **perfect tense** and the **imperfect tense**. In this article we will be looking at the **pluperfect tense**.
The pluperfect tense sounds complicated but is actually pretty straight forward.

### When to use the pluperfect tense?

The pluperfect tense is used to describe something that **had happened** or **had been true** at some point in the past. In English, you will see the pluperfect used in sentences with a form like “I had gone” or “you’d given”.

**For example:**
He had come home late. ⇨ Er war spät nach Hause gekommen.
We had forgotten his birthday. ⇨ Wir hatten seinen Geburtstag vergessen.

### Forming a sentence in the pluperfect tense

The pluperfect tense is formed in a similar way to the perfect tense in that it has two parts:

- The first part is the imperfect tense of either [**haben**](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/1567/the-german-verb-haben-to-have) or [**sein**](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/1480/the-german-verb-sein-to-be).

- ​

- The second part is the **past participle**.

Some verbs are built with sein and others with haben. Which verb to use follows the same rule we discussed in our **perfect tense** post. The majority of German past tense sentences are constructed using the verb haben, however when talking about something movement related, you would use the verb sein.

**Pluperfect tense with haben**

The table below shows how a basic sentence is formed using the verb haben. You will see that haben is shown in the imperfect tense.

| **Pronoun**   | **haben** | **Past Participle** | **Meaning**            |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ich           | hatte     | gelesen             | I had read             |
| du            | hattest   | gelesen             | you had read           |
| er / sie / es | hatte     | gelesen             | he / she / it had read |
| wir           | hatten    | gelesen             | we had read            |
| ihr           | hattet    | gelesen             | you had read           |
| sie / Sie     | hatten    | gelesen             | they / you had read    |

**Example sentences:**

I had forgotten my wallet. ⇨ Ich **hatte** meinen Geldbeutel **vergessen**. (Literal: I had my wallet forgotten.)

He had lent me €100. ⇨ Er **hatte** mir 100€ **geliehen**. (Literal: He had me €100 lent.)

We had bought him a car. ⇨ Wir **hatten** ihm ein Auto **gekauft**. (Literal: We had him a car bought.)

| ------------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| ich           | war      | gefahren            | I had driven             |
| du            | warst    | gefahren            | you had driven           |
