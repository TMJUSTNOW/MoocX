You will feel like youâ€™re back in the 30â€™s when you sit in the cable car in Stuttgart. This Seilbahn (cable car) was built in 1929 and at 11km/h, it was the fastest cable car in Germany at this time. The cable car itself was technically refurbished in 2004 and since then is back in use. The outside, however, still looks like the original from 1929. You can use the cable car with an ordinary public transport ticket.

Donâ€™t miss the Ritter Sport museum 20 km from Stuttgart in Waldenbuch (Alfred-Ritter-StraÃŸe 27 in 71111 Waldenbuch).

Here you can find a chocolate museum and a chocolate fan shop where you can buy all sorts of things to do with chocolate. They even have their own coffee store in there, offering yummy chocolate shakes and pastries.
