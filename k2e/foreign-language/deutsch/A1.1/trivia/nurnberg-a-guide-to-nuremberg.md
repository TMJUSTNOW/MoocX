### Nürnberg – A Guide to Nuremberg

With 500 000 inhabitants, Nuremberg is Bavaria’s second largest city and is situated in the Franconia area. It is especially crowded with tourists during the winter season due to the famous Nuremberg Christmas market. Nuremberg used to be a very popular destination for German kings during the Holy Roman Empire. Even Martin Luther described Nuremberg as the sun among the moon and the stars. Nowadays Nuremberg is a city well known for its quality of living and is ranked number 25 in the Worldwide Quality of Living Survey.

### Sights:

Christkindlmarkt: The most favourite sight in Nuremberg is the Christmas market at the “Hauptmarkt”, which is the bustling square in the heart of the city. In the Northwest of the square is the famous fountain “Schöner Brunnen” (Beautiful Fountain). This fountain is 19m high and was built in the late 14th century. The fountain is decorated with a vision of golden figures. A local superstition says that if you turn the small black ring three times (located on one side of the fountain) your wish will come true. It is a common tourist mistake to think you should turn the more obvious golden ring instead.

The passageway is called “Felsengänge” and was burrowed into the sandstone in the 14th century. The passageway was used as a shelter during the Second World War. You can only see this tunnel as part of a tour. Tickets are sold at the brewery “Hausbrauerei Alstadthof” and cost €4,50. It’s best to take a jacket with you as it can get pretty cold down there.

Built in the 12th century and used as residency for kings and queens. Take a look at the tower “Sinwellturm” and the 48m deep well “Tiefer Brunnen” which still yields drinking water.

Nuremberg Trials Courthouse: This is the place where the Nazi war criminals were sent to justice. The courtroom was closed down for renovations but reopened in 2010.

### Tours:

The best English tour is the Old Town walking tour which is a 2.5 hour tour. The tour leaves from Hauptmarkt and costs €9 per person.

### Sleeping:

Prices can get high during Christmas time and the toy fair in late January. So book well in advance during this time of year.
The Lette ‘m sleep (Frauentromauer 42) is the place to go if you are on a budget. A dorm room will cost about €18 per night.

A good mid range hotel is the [Aria Hotel](http://www.aria-hotel.de/) (Zufuhrstr. 10) which is situated close to the city centre. The hotel is a three star hotel and has very modern and light rooms. A double room costs €50 per night.

Also situated in the city centre is the hotel [Le Méridien Grand Hotel Nürnberg](http://www.lemeridiennuernberg.com/). A real luxury hotel with stunning rooms. A double room costs €400 a night.

### Eating:

A traditional German restaurant is the [Sudhaus](http://www.sudhausnuernberg.de/) (Bergstraße 20) where you will get German and Franconia specialties like “Nürnberger Bratwurste”(Nuremberg sausages) or “Fränkischer Sauerbraten” (Franconia sour beef). Meals cost around €12.

Don’t miss the “Nordic Hour” Sunday to Thursday at 11pm and Friday + Saturday at midnight where the cocktails are much cheaper 😀

[Bar Nürnberg](http://bar-nuernberg.de/) (Theresienplatz 1) offers great cocktails too. The owner is well known in Nuremberg and the bar is always crowded. (Picture left)

### Shopping:

Nuremberg’s main shopping miles are Breite Gasse and Karolinenstraße. This is the place where you will find all the chain and big department stores. If you’re looking for a souvenir head to the castle. There are small shops with typical Nuremberg and German things. 

### Tips:

You can avoid expensive shopping if you head to the Outlet Store Butzers (Klingenhofstraße 70-72). Here you can find brand clothes for men, women and children. If this outlet is not enough you can head to Herzogenaurach which is the home of Adidas. Here you can find the Adidas, Puma, Nike and S.Oliver Outlet.
