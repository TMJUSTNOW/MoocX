### Tours:

If you fancy a boat tour, you can either do a tour at the Port of Hamburg or you can do a tour at the Alster Lake (Alster-Touristik, 1,50‚Ç¨)

There is also a bus tour, the Hamburg City Tour, with a double-decker bus which will take you to all the sights in about 1.5 hours. You can hop on and off whenever you like. (Tickets cost 15‚Ç¨.)

### Hotels:

Book your hotel ahead, especially at the weekend. There are a lot of festivals going on in the summer and hotels get booked up quickly.

If you are on a budget, head down to [Backpackers St. Pauli](http://www.backpackers-stpauli.de) (Bernstorffstrasse 98) A dorm will cost about 23‚Ç¨ the night. The stuff is friendly and the location is great.

If you are looking for a mid-range Hotel, we can recommend the [Mercure Hotel Hamburg Arena](http://www.mercure.com/hotel-7550-mercure-hotel-hamburg-arena/index.shtml). The location is great and it is very clean. A double room will cost around 75‚Ç¨. (Kieler Strasse 333)

A very nice top end hotel is the [Fairmont Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten](http://www.hvj.de/de/index.php) (Neuer Jungfernstieg 9-14) The hotel is situated directly at the waterfront at Inner Alster Lake. Prices will start at 200‚Ç¨ per night.

### Eating:

Hamburg is well known for its seafood. Unfortunately, the city centre doesn‚Äôt offer very much. That‚Äôs why you should head to either Schanzenviertel, the Port or to the Speicherstadt.

[](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Hamburg-Fischerei.jpg)To get delicious seafood, head to the restaurant Fischereihafen (Gro√üe Elbstra√üe 143) in Hamburg-Altona. This is Hamburg‚Äôs top seafood restaurant and queues are likely. To guarantee a seat here, book in advance. Mains will cost about 30‚Ç¨.

Very good German cuisine is served at [Das Parlament](https://www.jabbalab.com/blog/2335/www.parlament-hamburg.de/pages/frameset.html) (Rathausmarkt 1). The restaurant is inside the town hall and definitely worth a visit. Their drinks are worth trying and have a look at the ‚ÄúRose Room‚Äù.

One of the most popular German restaurants in Hamburg is [St√§ndige Vertretung](http://www.staev.com) (Stadthausbr√ºcke 1-3). It has 200 seats and you can often see prominent German people in there. The restaurant is decorated with pictures from important German politicians and it is never empty in there.

### Drinking:

[Bar Rossi](http://www.13ter-stock.de) , located in the district Schanzenviertel (Max-Brauer-Allee 279, is a nice bar next to the Instant Sleep Hostel (in the case you are a party animal, book your stay in that hostel). The bar is pompous and has a very elegant touch. Mariah Carey once recorded a video in this bar.

[](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Hamburg-Pauli.jpg)Hamburg has some nice beach bars thanks to shipping tons of sand into the Hamburg industrial waterfront. The beach season starts in April and lasts until September. One nice bar is [Strand Pauli](http://www.strandpauli.de/strand.html) (Hafenstrasse 84). This bar overlooks the docks and has excellent beer and sausages üôÇ

### Shopping:

The main shopping districts in central Hamburg are West of the Hauptbahnhof along Spitalerstrasse and M√∂nckebergstrasse. Other shopping districts are in Schanzenviertel, Hamburg-Altona and St. Pauli/Reeperbahn.

### Insider Tips:

To get away with a cheaper boat trip, take the city harbour ferries. They will take you up the river on an ordinary ticket price. Ferry number 62 from Landungsbr√ºcken to Finkenwerder is a good ferry to catch.

[](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Hamburg-Empire-Riverside.jpg)If you want to see a very rare sight, head to the Hamburg harbour. There is a floating church on one of the containers. There is a service every Sunday at 3pm. (Hohe Br√ºcke 2)

Enjoy the view above Hamburg for free at the bar 20up im Empire Riverside Hotel (Bernhard-Nocht-Stra√üe 97). Enjoy the amazing view 90m above Hamburg from that cocktail bar with a giant Panorama platform. Their bar is 21 meter long with such a big choice of different cocktails.
