There is the **Chinese Tower** with beer banks all around, a really lovely lake called **Kleinhesseloher See** and a **Japanese Teahouse.**

**City bus 100** is an affordable way to discover Munich. This bus doesn‚Äôt cost you more than a public transport ticket. If you prefer a hop-on-hop-off bus tour, you should take the **M√ºnchener Stadtrundfahrten** bus (13‚Ç¨ adult).

## Hotels:

A good and affordable hostel is the **Wombat‚Äôs City Hostel** at Munich Hauptbahnhof (Central). A dorm will cost [![Wombat-s-City-Hostel-Munich-in-Muenchen](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Wombat-s-City-Hostel-Munich-in-Muenchen-150x150.jpg)](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Wombat-s-City-Hostel-Munich-in-Muenchen.jpg)12-24‚Ç¨, a double room 70‚Ç¨.

## Restaurants:

**Weisses Br√§uhaus:** Here you can get traditional Bavarian food. Enjoy your beer with a Weisswurst (veal sausage) and a Bretzel (pretzel). Mains will cost around 10‚Ç¨. (Im Tal 10)

**Prinz Myschkin:** The best Vegetarian Restaurant in town. The menu is very Asian influenced. Mains will cost about 12‚Ç¨. (Hackenstrasse 2)

Munich has its own village of clubs. This village is called **Kultfabrik** and **Optimolwerke** which is next to the Ostbahnhof (Munich East Station). Her you‚Äôll find about 40 clubs, pubs and bars.

The poshest place to go is **P1**. That‚Äôs the place where you‚Äôll find celebrities.

## Festivals:

[![mucno_phototour29](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/mucno_phototour29-150x150.jpg)](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/mucno_phototour29.jpg)The biggest festival is of course the legendary **Oktoberfest** which takes place every year from mid September to the first Sunday in October. Millions of people around the world come every year to experience the Oktoberfest. Here you will find many beer tents, food stands with sausages, pretzles, gingerbread hearts and many roller coasters. If you are planning to visit Munich during Oktoberfest, make sure to book your hotel well in advance.

## Shopping:

The main shopping mile is **Kaufingerstra√üe** and **Neuhauser Stra√üe**. Here you will find all the big names and brands. I personally like **Sendlinger Stra√üe** (turn into Rosenstra√üe at Marienplatz and you will automatically come out in Sendlinger Stra√üe) for shopping. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find some unique stores.

There are two big shopping centres which are not too far from the city centre (but you need to catch the undergrond to get there). One is the **OEZ** near the Olympiastadium, the other one is the **Riem Arcaden** near the Messe (Fair).

## Insider Tips:

And here are some insider tips, which you wouldn‚Äôt necessarily find in a Munich Guide üòÄ

**Leopoldstra√üe:** Leopoldstra√üe in Munich-Schwabing has a few good options. This street has plenty of bars and restaurants but you will find good shopping there too. The best way to get there is the underground. Take Line U3 or U6 to ‚ÄúGiselastra√üe‚Äù or ‚ÄúM√ºnchner Freiheit‚Äù. I always loved to go to the **Mexican Bar Don Luca **(Leopoldstra√üe 44, [http://www.donluca.de/](http://www.donluca.de/)). They do really yummy food there and great cocktails. The atmosphere in there is nice and the place is really popular among the Munich people.

Not far from Leopoldstra√üe is the shopping mile **‚ÄúHohenzollernstra√üe‚Äù.** Great place to get trendy clothes and shoes. Another good spot for shopping is **Residenzstra√üe** and **Theatinerstra√üe**.

Munich is the most expensive city in Germany and therefore the prices are quite high when it comes to rent, shopping, restaurants, hotels, food and drinks. That‚Äôs why I recommend getting a drink in the [**Wombats Hostel Bar**](http://www.wombats-hostels.com/munich/) if you are on a budget. I haven‚Äôt seen any other place in Munich which has the same low prices.

If you want a great view over Munich for free, go to the **Cafe Glockenspiel** ([http://www.cafe-glockenspiel.de/](http://www.cafe-glockenspiel.de/index.html)) Marienplatz. This Cafe is in the 5th floor and you will also have a great view of the Glockenspiel.
