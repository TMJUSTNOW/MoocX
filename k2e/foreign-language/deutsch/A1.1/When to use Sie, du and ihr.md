# When to use Sie, du and ihr

### Sie, du and ihr

In English, there is only one word to say **you** while in German there are three different words. But donâ€™t worry â€“ the rule for when to use each of these three words is quite straight forward and easy to understand. The three words we are talking about are **du**, **ihr** and **Sie**. Below weâ€™ll show you when to use which word. Learn and enjoy the German language with **Jabba****lab**! ðŸ™‚

Table: Du, ihr and Sie

|              | Singular | Plural |
| ------------ | -------- | ------ |
| **Informal** | du       | ihr    |
| **Formal**   | Sie      | Sie    |

**Tip:** In most cases you should start off using the informal **du** and **ihr** forms as you will most likely be practising with people you know and interact with often. Get comfortable with these first and then move onto the **Sie** form. Do not worry if you use the wrong one as you will still be understood.
