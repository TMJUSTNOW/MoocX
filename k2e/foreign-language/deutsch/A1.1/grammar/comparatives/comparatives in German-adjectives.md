# Comparatives in German – Adjectives

In this blog we want to look at expressing yourself with comparatives in German. In English, comparatives are written with –**er** on the end, e.g. easier, stronger, taller, or with use of the word **more** e.g. more beautiful.

Similarly in German, you add an **–er** to the end of most adjectives. Adjectives that end in **-el** or **-er**, drop the final **-e** to form the comparative. For example: **teuer – teurer**

When using comparatives in German, you have to build the sentence with **als** (than). For example: Das Haus von Kim ist schöner als das Haus von Nadine.

If you want to say that somehing is *as good as *something or someone else you use **genauso**…**wie** or **so**…**wie **in German.

For example:

**Kim hat ein genauso schönes Haus wie Nadine.** – Kim has a house as nice as Nadine
**Sie ist nicht so jung wie du** – She’s not as young as you.

When forming the comparatives in German, you need to be aware that the first **a**,**o** or **u** in the sentence can often change to **ä**,**ö**, or **ü**

Here are some useful adjectives with their comparative form:

| **German**          | **English**                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| alt – älter         | old – older                |
| groß – größer       | tall/big – taller/bigger   |
| jung – jünger       | young – younger            |
| klein – kleiner     | small – smaller            |
| klug – klüger       | clever – more clever       |
| langsam – langsamer | slow – slower              |
| nett – netter       | nice – nicer               |
| schnell – schneller | fast – faster              |
| schön – schöner     | beautiful – more beautiful |

As always, there are a couple of exceptions with comparatives in German. The words **gut** (good) and **viel** (much) go to **besser** (better) and **mehr** (more). These are pretty simple to remember as they follow the same pattern as in English.
