## German Two-Way Prepositions

A preposition is a word such as for, without or to. Prepositions show the relationship of a noun or pronoun to some other words and are usually placed before the noun or pronoun.

For example:
This cake is for you.
I can’t do it without your help.
He moves to Germany.

## Prepositions and the Cases


German prepositions break down into four groups. Some of them use the [accusative](../15767/german-accusative-prepositions.html) and some use the [dative](../15792/german-dative-prepositions.html) or genitive case. On top of this, there are also some that can be either accusative or dative, depending on the context of the sentence. 

In this blog we’ll be looking at the ones that can be either accusative or dative. For more information on prepositions that are strictly accusative take a look at our [German Accusative Prepositions Blog](../15767/german-accusative-prepositions.html) and for more info on the dative ones read our [German Dative Prepositions Blog](../15792/german-dative-prepositions.html). 

## Two-Way Prepositions


Let’s look at the nine little beauties that can be either accusative or dative:

Here is a quick overview:- Prepositions in the accusative case describe movement or show a change of location. These prepositions can answer questions that start with: Where to…? For example:Sie wollen auf die Party. (They want to go to the party.) ⇨ Where do they want to go to?Prepositions in the dative case describe positions or refer to a static location. These prepositions can answer questions that start with: Where…? For example:Deine Tasche liegt auf dem Tisch. (The bag is on the table.) ⇨ Where is the bag?|Tip

an + das = ans
an + dem = am
auf + das = aufs
in + das = ins
in + dem = im


One of the first issues you will encounter when learning these prepositions is:

Which case to use depends on the meaning. Here is a quick overview:
|If you aren’t quite confident with the prepositions and their shortened forms, stick to the long form, for example hinter dem or über das instead of hinterm and übers. It’s only the most frequently used ones that you should remember as they are quite commonly used.
