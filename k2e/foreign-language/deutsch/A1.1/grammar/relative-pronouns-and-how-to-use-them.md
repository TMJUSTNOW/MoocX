### What is a relative pronoun?

A relative pronoun is used to make it clear who or what you are talking about. The English relative pronouns are **who**, **which**, **whom** and **that**.

For example: 

Thatâ€™s the woman **who** bumped into my car last week.

This is the house **which** needs cleaning.

The ring **that** you bought was quite expensive.

A relative pronoun is also used to give further information about someone or something.

For example:

John, **who** is a very good doctor, wants to open his own practice next year.

My cat, **which** is 15 years old, is really ill.

The German relative pronouns are declined as follows:

When to use which relative pronoun depends on the gender, the case and whether the relative pronoun refers to something singular or plural. Relative clauses are always separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma.
