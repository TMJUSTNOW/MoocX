## German Weak Nouns

German nouns can change according to their gender, case and number. This is called “declension”. Some German masculine nouns have a weak declension – this means that they end in -en, or if the word ends in a vowel, in -n. This happens in every case, except in the nominative. Here is a table to illustrate this:
