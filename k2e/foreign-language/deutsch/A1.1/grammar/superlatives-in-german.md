# How to use Superlatives in German

### [](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/superlatives.jpg)The Best Most Super Superlatives in German

In this post we want to look at expressing yourself with superlatives in German. In English, superlatives are written with **est** on the end, e.g. easiest, strongest, tallest etc.

In German, you add ste or este to the simple form of the adjective. Adjectives that end in -t, -tz, -z, -sch, -ss, â€“ÃŸ, au and eu are the ones that would use este, the rest would use ste. If the adjective is describing something plural, you add an -n to the end.

### Lets look at some examples of Superlatives in German:

Das ist das schnellste Auto (schnell) â€“ That is the fastest car

Ich habe die neuesten Schuhe (neu) â€“ I have the newest shoes

Sie ist die schÃ¶nste Frau (schÃ¶n) â€“ She is the most beautiful woman

This is of course not the end of the story with superlatives in German. Word order can affect how the superlative is formed. Consider the following example:

Q- Who is the fastest man?

A- He is the fastest man or
A- That man is the fastest

In this example, the superlative in English is written the same the fastest. This isnâ€™t the case with superlatives in German. Here is the same example in German:

A- Er ist der schnellste Mann

A- Dieser Mann ist am schnellsten

This form of superlative is constructed with am before the adjective followed by -sten or -esten at the end and is used when the adjective appears at the end of the sentence.

### Some more examples:

Marys Katze ist sÃ¼ÃŸ aber meine Katze ist am sÃ¼ÃŸesten â€“ Marys cat is cute but my cat is the cutest

Ich habe drei Tanten und Lisa ist am kleinsten â€“ I have three aunts and Lisa is the smallest

In Hannover war es heute kalt, aber in MÃ¼nchen war es am kÃ¤ltesten â€“ It was cold today in Hannover but in Munich it was the coldest.

### And what about the Cases?

The ending of a superlative will change according to the case. But donâ€™t panic. The rules for the endings are pretty straight forward.

Here are some example sentences for every case:

Nominative:
Er ist der schÃ¶nste Mann der Welt. â€“ He is the most beautiful man in the world.
Sie ist die schÃ¶nste Frau der Welt. â€“ She is the most beautiful woman in the world.
Das ist das schnellste Auto der Welt. â€“ This is the fastest car in the world.

Accusative: 
Ich sehe den schÃ¶nsten Mann der Welt. â€“ I see the most beautiful man in the world.
Ich sehe die schÃ¶nste Frau der Welt. â€“ I see the most beautiful woman in the world.
