# The German Preposition 'Bei'

How would you translate the following sentences into German?

1. **Bei diesem heißen Wetter, würde ich nie Socken tragen.**
2. **Sie arbeitete bei Tag und bei Nacht.**

Most German students learn early on that it is often a [different German preposition](https://www.thoughtco.com/german-grammar-prepositions-1444472)that replaces the main English equivalent in a sentence. What I find interesting is how the dative preposition *bei/by* was once written the same way in both Old English and Middle High German (*bi*) and meant the same thing (near), yet they both have evolved to mean also different things.

For instance *bei* can mean today, depending on the context *near, at, by, among, in case of. *On the other hand, in English it means *bei, neben (beside), bis (until), mit (with), nach (after), um (around), von (from), über (over).*

German learners should not despair, as there remains sufficient phrasal contexts where *bei* equals 'by'. (One of them being the second expression stated at the beginning of this article -> 'She worked by day and by night.' However, the first example translates into "I would never wear socks in this hot weather.')

### **WHEN TO USE PREPOSITION BEI**

Here are several examples of the main uses and meaning of *bei*, including common phrases which are not translated with 'by' in English.

- When stating that something is nearby or in the vicinity. It can often replace *in der Nähe von*:

- When stating something (a thing, an event etc) or someone is at a place or event:
  *Sie lebt bei ihrer Tante* - She is living with her aunt.


- During an event; while one is doing something:
  *Sie ist beim Rennen hingefallen* - She fell while running.
- Used when describing 'with':

As you have probably realized, the dilution of *bei* into many varying meanings, is reflected likewise when looking upon the German translation of 'by.' Even the main connection between by and bei, namely when describing the physical proximity of something, varies. However, in general, a sentence that contains a 'by' prepositional phrase that describes a physical proximity, is most likely to be translated into *bei*.

Let's look at the following translations:

### **WHEN 'BY' IS BEI:**

Remember to keep in mind that these translations aren't necessarily reversible, meaning just because sometimes "by" can mean *nach*, that doesn't mean that *nach*will always mean "by." When it comes to prepositions, it is always best to first learn which grammatical case it goes with and then to learn popular combos (i.e verbs, expressions) these prepositions occur frequently with.
