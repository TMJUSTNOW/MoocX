# An Introduction to German Prepositions

A preposition is a word that shows the relationship of a noun or a pronoun to some other word in the sentence. Some examples of such words in German are *mit* (with), *durch* (through), *für* (for), *seit* (since). The **key points** to remember when using a preposition (*Präposition*) in a German sentence are:

- The noun/pronoun which the preposition modifies will always be in either the accusative, dative or genitive case.


- Prepositions are unchangeable. *

Most prepositions are placed before the noun/pronoun they modify.

\* "changes" can occur such as in prepositional contractions, however, such prepositions are combined with definite articles to form one word rather than changed.

Learning prepositions may seem like entering a battlefield. True, prepositions are one of the trickier elements of [German grammar](https://www.thoughtco.com/german-grammar-checklist-1444497), but once you've mastered the cases that go with each preposition, your battle is half won. The other half of the battle is knowing which preposition to use. For instance, the English preposition "to" can be translated into at least six different ways in German.

### English vs German Preposition - Example

German prepositions and their English counterpart aren’t always the same. The German preposition **in** for example is the same as the English preposition **in** but can be also used as **into** or **to**.

**For example:**
Markus ist **in** der Stadt. ⇨ Markus is **in** town.
Ich ging **in** die Post. ⇨ I went **into** the post office.
Er möchte nicht **in** die Kirche. ⇨ He doesn’t want to go **to** church.

Therefore it‘s important to get the idea out of your mind straight away that there is always a parallel meaning between German prepositions that resemble English prepositions because prepositions usually have more than one meaning.

### **PREPOSITIONAL CASES**

German prepositions break down into **four groups**. There are three prepositional cases: the accusative, the dative, and the genitive. On top of this, there is also a group of prepositions that can take on either the accusative or dative case, depending on the meaning of the sentence.
Commonly used prepositions such as *durch, für, um *always take on the accusative, whereas [other common prepositions](https://www.thoughtco.com/prepositional-pitfalls-in-german-1444774) such as *bei, mit, von, zu *will always take the [dative case](https://www.thoughtco.com/using-german-dative-prepositions-correctly-1444496).

On the other hand, prepositions in the dual-prepositions group (also called [two-way prepositions](https://www.thoughtco.com/two-way-doubtful-prepositions-in-german-1444444)) such as *an, auf, in *will take on the accusative case if they can answer the question **where to** an action or object is going, whereas these same prepositions will take on the dative case, if they describe **where** the action is taking place.
