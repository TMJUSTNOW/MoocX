# These Prepositions Take the Genitive Case in German

A few German prepositions are governed by the genitive case. That is, they take an object in the genitive case.

There are only a few common genitive prepositions in German, including: *(**an)**statt* (instead of), *außerhalb/**innerhalb* (outside/inside of), *trotz* (in spite of), *während*** **(during) and *wegen* (because of). Notice that most of the time the genitive prepositions can be translated with "of" in English.

Even *während* can be rendered as "in the course of," as well as "during."

Other genitive prepositions include: *angesichts* (in view of), *beiderseits* (on both sides of), *diesseits* (this side of), *jenseits** *(on the other side of) and *laut* (according to).

The genitive prepositions are often used with the dative in spoken German, particularly in certain regions. If you want to blend in with the local speakers and not sound too stuffy, you can use them in the dative also, but purists will want to learn the genitive forms.
