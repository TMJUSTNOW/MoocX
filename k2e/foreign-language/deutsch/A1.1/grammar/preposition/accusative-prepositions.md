# German Accusative Prepositions

In German, prepositions can be followed by nouns in various cases. An accusative preposition will always be followed by an object (a noun or pronoun) in the[ accusative case](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-four-german-noun-cases-4064290). 

### Prepositions and the Cases

German prepositions break down into **four groups**. Some of them use the **accusative** and some use the **dative** or **genitive** case. On top of this, there are also some that can be either **accusative or dative**, depending on the context of the sentence. When using a preposition, the article of the noun may change depending on the gender and case.

### Accusative Prepositions

There are **six** prepositions which are strictly linked to the accusative case. Let’s have a look at a table that shows you the prepositions in connection with the definite article der, die and das:

| Preposition          | Masculine | Feminine  | Neuter     |
| -------------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| bis (until, till)    | bis den   | bis die   | bis das    |
| durch (through, by)  | durch den | durch die | **durchs** |
| für (for)            | für den   | für die   | **fürs**   |
| gegen (against, for) | gegen den | gegen die | gegen das  |
| ohne (without)       | ohne den  | ohne die  | ohne das   |
| um (around, for, at) | um den    | um die    | **ums**    |

As these prepositions are followed by the accusative case the masculine article **der** will change to **den**. After a few German accusative prepositions, a shortened form of the definite article can be merged with the preposition to make one word:

durch + das = **durchs**
für + das = **fürs**
um + das = **ums**

**Example sentences:**
**Bis** nächsten Sonntag! ⇨ Until next Sunday!
Wir laufen **durch den** Park. ⇨ We are walking through the park.
Vielen Dank **für die** Auskunft. ⇨ Thank you very much for the advice.
Ich stellte das Fahrrad **gegen die** Wand. ⇨ I put the bike against the wall.
Der Bahnhof ist gleich **um die** Ecke. ⇨ The train station is around the corner.

As you can see, some articles, pronouns and adjectives change their form in the accusative case. You can fresh your memory up by reading our blog [How the German Cases work](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/795/how-the-german-cases-work-nominative-accusative-dative-and-genitive).

### TYPES OF ACCUSATIVE PREPOSITIONS

There are two kinds of accusative prepositions:

1. Those that are always accusative and never anything else.
2. Certain two-way prepositions that can be either accusative or dative, depending on how they are used.



See the chart below for a complete list of each type.

Luckily, there are only five accusative prepositions you need to memorize. Another thing that makes this group of prepositions easier is the fact that only the masculine gender (*der*) changes in the accusative case. The plural, feminine (*die*) and neuter (*das*) genders don't change in the accusative.

In the German-English examples below, the accusative preposition is** **bolded. The object of the preposition is italicized.

- **Ohne ***Geld* geht's nicht**. **( ****Without** *money* it won't work.)
- Sie geht *den Fluss*** entlang. **(She is walking **along** *the river.*)
- Er arbeitet **für** *eine große Firma***. **(He works **for** *a big company*.)
- Wir fahren **durch*** die Stadt***. **(We're driving **through** *the city*.)
- Schreibst du einen Brief **an ***deinen Vater?*** (**Are you writing a letter **to** *your father*?)

Notice in the second example above that the object (*Fluss*) comes before the preposition (*entlang*). Some German prepositions use this reverse word order, but the object must still be in the correct case.

### WHAT ARE THE ACCUSATIVE PREPOSITION IN GERMAN?

Here is a list of the accusative-only prepositions and their English translations.  

| **Accusative Prepositions**              |                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Deutsch**                              | **Englisch**           |
| **bis***                                 | until, to, by          |
| **durch**                                | through, by            |
| **entlang**                              | along, down            |
| Note: The accusative preposition *entlang *usually goes after its object. |                        |
| **für**                                  | for                    |
| **gegen**                                | against, for           |
| **ohne**                                 | without                |
| **um**                                   | around, for, at (time) |
| *Note: The German preposition *bis* is technically an accusative preposition, but it is almost always used with a second preposition (*bis zu, bis auf*) in a different case, or without an article (*bis April, bis Montag, bis Bonn*). |                        |

 

| **Two-Way Prepositions****Accusative/Dative** |                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| The meaning of a two-way preposition often changes based on whether it is used with the accusative or dative case. See below for the grammar rules. |                                |
| **Deutsch**                              | **Englisch**                   |
| **an**                                   | at, on, to                     |
| **auf**                                  | at, to, on, upon               |
| **hinter**                               | behind                         |
| **in**                                   | in, into                       |
| **neben**                                | beside, near, next to          |
| **über**                                 | about, above, across, over     |
| **unter**                                | under, among                   |
| **vor**                                  | in front of, before,ago (time) |
| **zwischen**                             | between                        |

### THE RULES OF TWO-WAY PREPOSITIONS

The basic rule for determining whether a two-way preposition should have an object in the accusative or dative case is motion versus location. If there is motion toward something or to a specific location (wohin?), then usually the object is accusative. If there is no motion at all or random motion going nowhere in particular (*wo?*), then that is usually dative**.** This rule applies only to the so-called two-way or dual prepositions in German. For example, a [dative-only preposition](https://www.thoughtco.com/using-german-dative-prepositions-correctly-1444496) like *nach* is always dative, whether there is motion or not. 

Here are two sets of examples showing motion versus location:

- Accusative: Wir gehen** ins Kino.** (We're going **to the movies**.) There is a motion toward a destination. In this case, that's the movie theater. 
- Dative: Wir sind** im Kino.** (We're **at the movies/cinema**.) We are already at the location and not traveling somewhere. 


- Accusative: Legen Sie das Buch** auf den Tisch.** (Put/Lay the book on the table.) The motion is the placement of the book toward the table.
- Dative: Das Buch liegt **auf dem Tisch.** (The book's lying **on the table.**) The book is already at its destination and not moving.

| All of the accusative prepositions except "entlang," "ohne" and "bis" form what are called "da- compounds" to express what would be a prepositional phrase in English. Da- compounds are not used for people (personal pronouns). Prepositions beginning with a vowel add a connecting r. See the examples below. |                                          |
| **THING**                                | **PERSON**                               |
| **dadurch:** through it, by it           | **durch ihn/sie:** through him/her       |
| **dafür:** for it                        | **für ihn/sie:** for him/her             |
| **dagegen:** against it                  | **gegen ihn/sie:** against him/her       |
| **darum:** for that reason               | **um ihn/sie:** around him/her           |
|                                          |                                          |

 

### IDIOMS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

A single German two-way preposition, such as *in* or *auf, *may have more than one English translation, as you can see above. In addition, you'll find many of these prepositions have yet another meaning in common everyday idioms and expressions.

Examples: *auf** dem Lande *(in the country), *um **drei** Uhr* (at three o'clock), *unter**uns* (among us), *am Mittwoch* (on Wednesday), *vor** **einer** Woche* (a week ago). Such expressions can be learned as vocabulary without worrying about the grammar involved.
