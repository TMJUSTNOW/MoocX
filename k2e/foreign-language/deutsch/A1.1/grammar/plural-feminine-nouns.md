## Plural Nouns

Forming the plural of English nouns follows mostly the same pattern. In most cases you have to add -s to the end of the noun.

For example:
credit card ⇨ credit cards
customer ⇨ customers

There are some nouns in English that are irregular and do not follow this rule.

For example:
information ⇨ information
tooth ⇨ teeth

In German, on the other hand, are different ways of making a noun plural. Which way to use mainly depends on the gender and the ending of a noun. Let’s look at the feminine nouns more closely.

### Feminine Nouns


Most feminine nouns add -n, -en or -nen to the singular noun to form their plural.

- Feminine nouns ending in -e just add -n to form their plural.

For example:
die Katze ⇨ die Katzen
- Feminine nouns ending in -in add -nen to form their plural.

For example:
die Kundin ⇨ die Kundinnen
Most other feminine nouns end in -en in their plural form.
For example:
die Rechnung ⇨ die Rechnungen
For example:
die Rechnung ⇨ die Rechnungen

die Münzedie Münzendie Meinungdie Meinungen

die Aufgabedie Aufgabendie Freundindie Freundinnen

- There are only a few feminine nouns that have an umlaut ä, ö or ü in their plural. These nouns often have one syllable only.

For example:
die Kuh (cow) ⇨ die Kühe
die Hand (hand) ⇨ die Hände

|Tip
|The rule of thumb for feminine nouns is that they mostly end in -en in their plural form (Katzen, Rechungen, Kundinnen). An umlaut ä, ö or ü appears very rarely in the plural form.
