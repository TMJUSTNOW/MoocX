### German Neutral Nouns

We all know how difficult it is to guess the right  gender if it comes to German nouns. The bad news is: There is no official rule for when to use der, die and das. The good news is: There are guidelines which will make it easier to choose between them. In this post we will be looking at the guidlines for das words. You might also want to check out our blog about [male nouns](../6096/german-masculine-nouns.html) and [female nouns](../6098/german-feminine-nouns.html). ðŸ™‚

            As far as I know, nouns having an international background/usage have a neutral gender. For example those with a latin origin (das Zentrum, das Museum), and others like Taxi (das Taxi), product (das Produkt), theater (das Theater), model (das Modell), program (das Programm). An interesting exception is coffee (der Kaffee).
