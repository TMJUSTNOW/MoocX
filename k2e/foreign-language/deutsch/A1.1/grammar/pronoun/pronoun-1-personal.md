## Personal Pronoun

You're maybe wondering what exactly is a **personal** pronoun?

A personal pronoun refers to a specific person or thing. They are simply**small words which replace nouns**, e.g. 'he', 'she', 'it', 'you', etc.

They refer to the person/people speaking (e.g. I/we), the person/people spoken to (e.g. you) or the person/people or thing(s) spoken about (e.g. he/she/it).

You will commonly see these being referred to as the 1st person, 2nd person and 3rd person, respectively.

To complicate matters, though, there are **several different forms of 'you' in German.**
