# When to use Sie, du and ihr

### Sie, du and ihr

In English, there is only one word to say **you** while in German there are three different words. But donâ€™t worry â€“ the rule for when to use each of these three words is quite straight forward and easy to understand. The three words we are talking about are **du**, **ihr** and **Sie**. Below weâ€™ll show you when to use which word. Learn and enjoy the German language with **Jabba****lab**! ðŸ™‚

 

### When to use du?

The word **du** is used when you talk to one person who you know very well. For example your family and your friends. The word **du** is also used for kids.

**Example sentences:**
Can you please give me that book? â‡¨ Kannst **du** mir bitte das Buch geben?
Will you marry me? â‡¨ Willst **du** mich heiraten?

------

### When to use ihr?

The word **ihr** is used when you talk to more than one person who you know very well.

**Example sentences:**
Where are you going tonight? â‡¨ Wohin geht **ihr** heute Abend?
You should do your homework! â‡¨ **Ihr** sollt eure Hausaufgaben machen!

------

### When to use Sie?

The word **Sie** is used when you talk to one person who you donâ€™t know so well or holds authority over you. For example your boss and strangers.

**Example sentences:**
Are you coming to work tomorrow? â‡¨ Kommen **Sie** morgen zur Arbeit?
Are you paying with cash or card? â‡¨ Zahlen **Sie** bar oder mit Karte?

The word **Sie** is also used when you talk to more than one person who you donâ€™t know so well.

**Example sentences:**
What do you want for breakfast today? â‡¨ Was wollen **Sie** heute zum FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck?
What would you like to drink? â‡¨ Was mÃ¶chten **Sie** trinken?

Table: Du, ihr and Sie

|              | Singular | Plural |
| ------------ | -------- | ------ |
| **Informal** | du       | ihr    |
| **Formal**   | Sie      | Sie    |

**Tip:** In most cases you should start off using the informal **du** and **ihr** forms as you will most likely be practising with people you know and interact with often. Get comfortable with these first and then move onto the **Sie** form. Do not worry if you use the wrong one as you will still be understood.

### DUZEN AND SIEZEN

The verb that describes using *Sie *to address someone is *siezen*. To utilize *du *with someone is *duzen. *It's best to use the *Sie *if you are not sure which to use. 

### MORE ABOUT 'YOU' IN GERMAN

Other important points about *Sie, du *and* ihr *are:

- The formal *Sie* is always capitalized. There are no exceptions to this rule. The *du* and *ihr* are usually written in lower case, but some older Germans capitalize them. That was the rule about 20 years ago, before they had the *Rechtschreibreform*. 


- *Sie* remains written as *Sie* whether you are using it in the plural or singular sense. For example, if you are formally addressing one or two Germans, you won't see a difference in writing:
  *Woher kommen Sie? *(*Where are you from, sir/madam?)Woher kommen Sie?*(*Where are you from, sirs/madams?)* 
- *Sie *(you, formal)* *takes the same verb form as *sie *(they)*, *which is why in conjugation tables, you will find both words at the bottom together.

### CHART OF 'YOU' IN GERMAN

In a nutshell:

| **Singular** | **Plural**  | **English meaning**                      |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| du trinkst   | ihr trinkt  | you or y'all are drinking                |
| Sie trinken  | Sie trinken | you (formal) or you (plural) are drinking |

### COMMON PROBLEM: THERE ARE FOUR *S**IES* AND FOUR *I**HRS*

Many German-language students have trouble initially with *ihr*. This could be because there are two *ihr*s. There are also multiple versions of *sie, *which can be complicated*. *Take a look at the following examples: 

- *Hey, kommt ihr heute Abend? *(Are **you guys** coming tonight?)
- *Ist das nicht ihr neuer Freund? *(Isn't that **her** new friend?)
- *Entschuldigen Sie. Ist das \**Ihr** Auto vor meiner Ausfahrt? *(Excuse me, sir/madam, is that your car in front of my driveway?) Note that the *Ihr* is capitalized as it is formal.
- *Entschuldigen Sie. Ist das \**Ihr** Auto vor meiner Ausfahrt? (*Excuse me, sirs/madams, is that your car in front of my driveway?)



Here are three examples for *sie/Sie*:

- *Woher kommen Sie? (* *Where are you from, sir/madam?*)
- *Woher kommen Sie?* (*Where are you from, sirs/madams?*)
- *Woher kommt sie?* (*Where is she from?*)
- *Woher kommen sie?* (*Where are they from?)*
