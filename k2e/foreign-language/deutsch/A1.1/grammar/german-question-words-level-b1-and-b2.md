            Hi Spuds,
Thanks for your questions. Well, these little words are fairly tricky as they normally have more than one meaning.
In general “woran” and “worüber” both mean “about what” but they also have other meanings that are different to each other.
The word “woran” for example, could also mean “what on”, for example: Woran soll ich den Mantel aufhängen? – What shall I hang the coat on? It could also mean “what of” for example: Woran ist sie gestorben. – What did she die of? It could also mean “where with”, for example: Man weiß bei ihm nie, woran man ist. – You never know where you are with him.
The same applies to worüber. It’s always best to learn these expressions as you come across them.
And the word wieso, weshalb and warum are all synonyms and all mean “why”. These are interchangeable. It’s best to stick to the one you feel most comfortable with 🙂
