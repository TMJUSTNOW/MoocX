## Plural Nouns

Forming the plural of English nouns follows mostly the same pattern. In most cases you have to add -s to the end of the noun.

For example:
dog ⇨ dogs
shop ⇨ shops

There are some nouns in English that are irregular and do not follow this rule.

For example:
mouse ⇨ mice
foot ⇨ feet

In German, on the other hand, are different ways of making a noun plural. Which way to use mainly depends on the gender and the ending of a noun. In our last blog we looked at [Feminine Plural Nouns](../15778/plural-feminine-nouns.html), in this blog we’ll be looking at the masculine and neuter nouns.

- Quite a few nouns also add an umlaut above the first vowel a, o or u to form the plural noun. In this case masculine plural nouns often keep the -e ending in the plural form while neuter nouns often end in -er. Nouns in this group often have one syllable.

For example:
der Stuhl ⇨ die Stühle
das Haus ⇨ die Häuser
The same rule applies to compound nouns. A compound noun is a noun made up of two or more words.
For example:
der Liegestuhl ⇨ die Liegestühle
das Kaufhaus ⇨ die Kaufhäuser
