# How Many Languages Should You Learn?



Learning a second language is an exciting thing for anyone to do and learning it well will give you a huge boost of confidence.
However, once you feel as though you have done a good job in learning this tongue will you be tempted to take on another and then another? Speaking more than two languages is an impressive feat but is it something you should do or not?

## How Many Do You Need or Want?

The key point here is to consider how many foreign tongues you could use or would want to use in the future? If you are thinking about studying for career purposes or for travelling then this is great. However, if it is something you plan to do purely as a hobby then you need to work out whether you have enough motivation to carry on with the process from start to finish. If you simply love learning languages then there is nothing wrong with picking up as many as you can but you might be better learning them one at a time in order to make sure that you learn them really well.

## Can You Practice Enough?

Many people think that if you learn more than one language you will end up getting confused between them. This shouldn’t really be a problem unless you try to learn them all at the same time or don’t learn them well. However, what you need to bear in mind is your future ability to practice the different tongues and keep your knowledge up to date. If you only speak one foreign language then it won’t be too difficult to read books, watch television, listen to music or speak to people using this language. Once you have a few different languages under your belt you will need to have the time and the motivation to practice them all from time to time.

## Are You Demanding of Yourself?

We all have different expectation levels for the things we do. This means that for some people it is better to learn one second language extremely well and be able to speak it almost to a native level after some time. Other people prefer the idea of learning a number of different tongues to a decent level. You are the only person who can decide which of these approaches best suits you. The best advice in this case is to follow your instincts and choose the level of studying which is going to keep you happy instead of biting off more than you can chew or not exploiting your talents enough.
