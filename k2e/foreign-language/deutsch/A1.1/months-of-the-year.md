### THE MONTHS (DIE MONATE)

The months are all masculine gender (**der**). There are two words used for July. **Juli** (YOO-LEE) is the standard form, but German-speakers often say **Julei** (YOO-LYE) to avoid confusion with **Juni**- in much the same way that **zwo** is used for **zwei**.

### PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES WITH DATES

To give a date, such as "on July 4th," you use **am** (as with the days) and the ordinal number (4th, 5th): **am vierten Juli**, usually written **am 4. Juli**.

The period after the number represents the -**ten** ending on the number and is the same as the -th, -rd, or -nd ending used for English ordinal numbers.

Note that numbered dates in German (and in all of the European languages) are always written in the order of day, month, year - rather than month, day, year. For example, in German the date 1/6/01 would be written 6.1.01 (which is Epiphany or Three Kings, the 6th of January 2001). This is the logical order, moving from the smallest unit (the day) to the largest (the year). To review the ordinal numbers, see our [German Numbers](https://www.thoughtco.com/counting-and-calculating-in-german-4066587) page. Here are some commonly used phrases for the months and calendar dates:

| in August(in June, October, etc.)        | **im August**(**im Juni**, **Oktober**, usw.) |
| on June 14th (spoken)on June 14, 2001 (written) | **am vierzehnten Juni****am 14. Juni 2001 - 14.7.01** |
| on the first of May (spoken)on May 1, 2001 (written) | **am ersten Mai****am 1. Mai 2001 - 1.5.01** |
|                                          |                                          |

 

The ordinal numbers are so-called because they express the order in a series, in this case for dates. But the same principle applies to the "first door" (**die erste Tür**) or the "fifth element" (**das fünfte Element**).

In most cases, the ordinal number is the cardinal number with a -**te** or -**ten** ending. Just as in English, some German numbers have irregular ordinals: one/first (**eins**/**erste**) or three/third (**drei**/**dritte**). Below is a sample chart with ordinal numbers that would be required for dates.
