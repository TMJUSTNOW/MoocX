## German Conditional Tense

Okay, first let‚Äôs deal with what the German conditional tense means. It‚Äôs one of the more specialised tenses as it deals with a specific situation. This situation is something that **would happen** or **would be true** under certain conditions.

**For example:**
I would buy you a ring if I had the money.
I would help him if I could.

In this blog we‚Äôll first show you when the conditional tense is used and how to form it. As always we have included some easy to follow example sentences that will help bring clarity to this aspect of German. Learn and enjoy the German language with **Jabba****lab**! üôÇ

### How to form the German conditional tense?

The conditional tense is formed in two parts.

- The first part is the **w√ºrde** form of the verb **werden**. You may see this referred to as the **subjunctive** but it‚Äòs easier to remember w√ºrde.
- The second part is the **infinitive** form of the verb which is usually placed at the end of the sentence.
