## German Imperfect Tense

Here we want to go through how you talk about the past in German. There are a few forms of the past tense in German. 

We were talking about the [perfect tense](../1011/past-tense-german-how-to-talk-about-the-past-in-german.html) in our last blog and in this article we will be looking at the imperfect tense.

### When to use the imperfect tense

- To talk about situations in the past such which have no link to the present anymore:
For example:
She bought a red bag which she gave her friend. ⇨ Sie kaufte eine rote Tasche, die sie ihrer Freundin schenkte.
For example:
She bought a red bag which she gave her friend. ⇨ Sie kaufte eine rote Tasche, die sie ihrer Freundin schenkte.

- A situation which describes how people felt in the past or how things were in the past:
For example:

- A situation which describes how people felt in the past or how things were in the past:
For example:
I was glad when he came home. ⇨ Ich war froh, als er nach Hause kam.
I was glad when he came home. ⇨ Ich war froh, als er nach Hause kam.


- It’s also used when something used to happen regularly
For example:
I played the piano every day. ⇨ Ich spielte jeden Tag Klavier.
For example:
I played the piano every day. ⇨ Ich spielte jeden Tag Klavier.

Forming a past tense sentence in the imperfect tense
Forming a sentence with the imperfect tense depends on whether the verb is a weak verb, a strong verb, or a mixed verb.

Forming the imperfect tense with weak and mixed verbs

To form the imperfect tense of a weak verb, you need to change the ending and leave the stem as it is, the same way as you do in the present tense. With mixed verbs the ending is the same as the weak verbs, however the stem will also change as it does in the present tense.

Here are a few examples of how to get a weak verb into the past tense:

spielen – to play – ich spielte

machen – to make, to do – ich machte
Here are a few examples of how to get a mixed verb into the past tense: 

kennen – to know – ich kannte

rennen – to run – ich rannte

Some [weak verbs](../880/how-german-verbs-work-in-the-present-tense-part-1.html) will change their spelling when used in the imperfect tense. This depends on which letter the stem of the weak verb ends with.

If it ends with d, t, m or n you need to put an extra e before the usual imperfect ending.

For example: 

ich arbeitete – I worked

ich redete – I talked

Forming the imperfect tense with strong verbs:

The main difference between weak and [strong verbs](../924/how-german-verbs-work-in-the-present-tense-part-2.html) in the imperfect tense is that strong verbs have different endings.

As with mixed verbs, the stem may change when going into the past tense.

Examples:

essen – to eat – ich aß
fahren – to drive – ich fuhr
trinken – to trink – ich trank

            This confuses me :S But good guide!

        

    


        
        
            Hello Willo,
What exactly confuses you? 🙂

        

    


        
        
            when speaking would germans use the imperfect or perfect tense?lh

        

    


        
        
            Hi Nils,
The perfect tense is more common to use in the spoken language 🙂

        

    


        
        
            @Nils, Germans would speak the perfect and and write the imperfect.

        

    


Thank you but I still have a question about the actual meaning of
I worked versus I was working, being the former for an action that started and ended in the past. The latter expresses an ongoing action that happened in the past durind a period of  time



        
        
            Hello Fernando,
Yes, theoretically “worked” is used if the action was in the past and has no effect to the future anymore. 
For example: “Vor 40 Jahren arbeitete ich bei Bosch.”
And if the action still has an effect on the future or if the action happened a short time ago it would be perfect tense.
For example: “Ich habe gestern nur 2 Stunden gearbeitet.”
But this is all in theory. Many people prefer to use the perfect tense. So if in doubt use the perfect tense 🙂

        

    


I’ve been learning German for a while now, and this site isn’t they was i have been learning it.
e.g
ich spielte
it should be ich spiele

        

    


        
        
            and the endings for weak verbs should be
ich spiele
du spielst
er spielt
sie spielt
wir spielen
ihr spielt
Sie spielen
sie spielen



        
        
            Also weak verbs have no change.
sometimes a change occurs in strong verbs, but only with du, er, sie, and es.
for example 
fahren – to travel
ich fahre
du fährst
er fährt
sie fährt
es fährt
wir fahren
ihr fahrt
Sie fahren
sie fahren



        
        
            Hello Lou,
What you said is correct in the present tense. But this is a blog about the imperfect tense. “Ich spielte” is the imperfect tense of “spielen” in the first person singular 🙂
