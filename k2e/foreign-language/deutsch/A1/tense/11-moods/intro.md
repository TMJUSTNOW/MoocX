German has two "moods"—indicative and subjunctive. The indicative tells of an action that really happened (or happens). Thus, "I speak, you go, we eat"—"ich spreche, du gehst, wir essen". This mood is used to describe what we do, what we did, and even what we will do. Notice the similarity to the word *indicate*. The present and past tenses are both indicative.

The subjunctive show possibility, doubt, and "what ifs". It is most commonly used in its "past tense form", known as "Konjunktiv II"—the "II" indicates that it is the 2nd subjunctive—the 1st subjunctive, more rarely used, is the "present subjunctive" (and will be discussed at a later date).

The subjunctive (Konjunktiv II) is formed from the simple past tense. To summarize its formation:

1. The subjunctive for weak verbs is identical to the past tense
2. The subjunctive of strong verbs takes the past tense stem (that is, without endings), adds an umlaut if the stem contains an a, o, or u, and adds the "subjunctive endings"
3. The subjunctive of mixed verbs is the same as the past tense, but the vowels are umlauted (as above), except that "e" is often used instead of "ä"

Thus, if you know the past tense, you know the subjunctive. Examples:

- sein: war—wäre
- haben: hatte—hätte
- werden: wurde—würde
- kommen: kam—käme
- arbeiten: arbeitete—arbetitete
- spielen: spielte—spielte
- können: konnte—könnte
- wissen: wusste—wüsste

The subjunctive can also be formed by combining the subjunctive form of "werden" (würde, würdest, etc.) with the infinitive. Thus, "ich würde kommen" means the same as "ich käme". We translate them the same: "I would come", and we almost always translate the subjunctive form as "would + verb".

The following guidelines for use should be kept in mind:

1. The subjunctive of weak verbs is rarely used because it can be confused with the past tense; the würde + infinitive construction is much preferred
2. The subjunctive of strong and mixed verbs is not usually used, except with certain high-frequency verbs: kommen, geben, gehen, wissen, lassen, and a few others; the würde + infinitive construction can also be used
3. The subjunctive form of the helping and modal verbs is used; the würde + infinitive construction is not used
