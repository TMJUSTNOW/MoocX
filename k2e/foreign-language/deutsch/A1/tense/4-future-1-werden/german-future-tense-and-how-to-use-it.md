## German Future Tense and How to use it

The basic future tense in German is the Futur I; it’s formed with the present tense of the verb werden (given in [section V.3](http://germanforenglishspeakers.com/verbs/present-and-simple-past/)) and the infinitive of the main verb.

The German future tense is very similar to the future tense in English. To talk about something in the future, you can use the present tense as you do in English.

**For example:**
We’re flying to France next year. ⇨ Wir fliegen nächstes Jahr nach Frankreich.
Ich spiele morgen Gittare. ⇨ I’m playing the guitar tomorrow.

However there is a dedicated German future tense used to talk about something that will happen in the future. Quite often it is used to emphasise something that will definitely happen in the future.

**Some example sentences:**

We do the same thing in English with *will*:

He will drive to Spain. ⇨ Er wird nach Spanien fahren.
You will go shopping tomorrow. ⇨ Du wirst morgen einkaufen gehen. 

### How is the German future tense formed?

The German future tense is formed using the normal present tense of the verb **werden**. When used on its own in a future tense sentence, it means **to become**, however in English we will often say **will become / will get / will be** instead.
**Table: The verb werden**

| **Pronoun**   | **werden** | **Meaning**           |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| ich           | werde      | I become              |
| du            | wirst      | you become            |
| er / sie / es | wird       | he / she / it becomes |
| wir           | werden     | we become             |
| ihr           | werdet     | you become            |
| sie / Sie     | werden     | they / you become     |

**Example sentences:**

I will be 25 on Saturday. ⇨ Ich **werde** am Samstag 25 Jahre alt. (Literal: I become on Saturday 25 years old.)

He will soon be a father. ⇨ Er **wird** bald Vater. (Literal: He becomes soon father.)

You will get better every day. ⇨ Ihr **werdet** jeden Tag besser. (Literal: You become every day better.)

 

### German Future Tense with additional Verb

When you want to talk about doing something in the future, you will need to construct the sentence in two parts.

- The first part is as above with the present tense form of the verb **werden**.

- ​

- The second part is the **verb** which explains what you will be doing. This verb goes to the end of the sentence.

**Example sentences:**

They will buy a car. ⇨ Sie **werden** ein Auto **kaufen**. (Literal: They will a car buy.)

You will win tomorrow. ⇨ Du **wirst** morgen **gewinnen**. (Literal: You will tomorrow win.)

I will kiss you. ⇨ Ich **werde** dich **küssen**. (Literal: I will you kiss.)

**Note:** With reflexive verbs, the reflexive pronoun (mich, dich, sich etc) comes straight after the present tense form of **werden**.

We hope this helps you learn how the German future tense is used. If you have any comments please feel free to leave them below.

To form the Futur II (future perfect), use *werden* + past participle + *haben/sein*. Again it's similar in English: *will have*. The only difference is that, as always in German, the non-conjugated verbs move to the end of the clause:

*Wenn ihr ankommt \**werde** ich ein Hotel **gefunden haben**.*
By the time you arrive, I **will have found** a hotel.
*Bis heute Abend \**werde** ich das Geschirr **gespült haben**.*
By this evening, I **will have done** the dishes.

In English we also have the more casual form "I’m going to..." to replace "I will..." This form does not exist in German, so don’t try to translate it literally: Ich gehe zu [verb] would not make sense. Just use werden instead.*
The futuristic present (Futuristisches Präsens) refers to a tendency in both languages to use the present tense for future events. In English we do this in two main situations: when we have arranged to do something in the near future ("I’m going to the movies tomorrow") and when referring to an action that will take place according to a fixed (usually printed) schedule or timetable ("The train leaves in half an hour"). German also uses the present tense for these situations:
*Meine Freundin \**besucht **mich nächstes Wochenende.*
My girlfriend **visits **[is visiting] me next weekend.
*Der Zug \**fährt** in 10 Minuten **ab**.*
The train **departs** in ten minutes.
(Note that we often use the progressive aspect in these situations -- "is visiting" -- which [doesn’t exist in German](http://germanforenglishspeakers.com/verbs/the-continuous-and-progressive-aspects/).)
There are a few situations where German uses the futuristic present and English does not. The most important is an offer or promise to do something:

| German (Präsens):Literal English (present):Correct English (future): | **Ich zahle** es dir morgen zurück.**I pay **you back tomorrow.**I’ll pay** you back tomorrow. | **Ich hole** dir eine Jacke.**I get** you a jacket.**I’ll get** you a jacket. |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|                                          |                                          |                                          |

There’s another case where use of the present is optional: predictions or speculation. In the case of speculation, we usually use may/might/maybe in English, and German uses vielleicht(perhaps):

| German (Präsens):German (Futur I):English (future): | Morgen **regnet** es.Morgen **wird** es **regnen**.Tomorrow it **will rain**. | Vielleicht **gehe** ich nächste Woche.Vielleicht **werde** ich nächste Woche **gehen.**I may **go** [Maybe I’ll **go**] next week. |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|                                          |                                          |                                          |

*(To be more specific: the verb phrase “going to” in English usually means that a future event is already planned or expected (“I’m going to do my homework later”) rather than the announcement of a decision (“I’ll do my homework later”). In German, “going to” will often have werden, or possibly schon or noch. Ich werde meine Hausaufgaben später machen; Ich mache meine Hausaufgaben schon/noch. But an announcement is in the futuristic present: Ich mache mein Hausaufgaben später.)
