## German Past Tense – How to talk about the Past in German

### [The Perfect Tense – A Common German Past Tense](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/perfect-tense.jpg)

We’re now going to jump back in time to the past tense in German. There are a few different forms of the past tense, but in this article we will be looking at the **Perfect Tense**. This is probably the most commonly used, especially in the spoken form.

### When to use the perfect tense?

- The perfect tense is used to talk about situations in the past:

- **For example:**
  I have played football. ⇨ Ich habe Fußball gespielt.
  She has been to the cinema. ⇨ Sie ist ins Kino gegangen.

### Forming a sentence in the perfect tense

The perfect tense is made up of 2 parts:

- The first part is the present tense of either [haben](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/1567/the-german-verb-haben-to-have) or [sein](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/1480/the-german-verb-sein-to-be). The majority of past tense German sentences are constructed using the verb **haben**, however when talking about something movement related, you would use the verb **sein**.

- ​

- The second part is the past tense version of the German verb called the **past participle**. This is equivalent to played, walked, gone etc. in English.

The first part is pretty straight forward. The second part, forming the **past participle** (the past tense German verb) is a little bit more involved. This depends on whether the verb is a **weak verb**, a **strong verb**, or a [mixed verb](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/12308/mixed-german-verbs).

**Past participle of weak and mixed verbs**

To form the past participle of a weak or mixed verb, you add **ge** to the beginning of the verb and **t** after the stem of the verb. Here are a few examples of how to get a weak verb into the past tense:

spielen (to play) ⇨ **ge**spiel**t**

lachen (to laugh) ⇨ **ge**lach**t**

lernen (to learn) ⇨ **ge**lern**t**

sagen (to say) ⇨ **ge**sag**t**

**Remember**: With mixed verbs (as with strong verbs), the stem of the verb may change when going into the German past tense.

**For example:**
bringen (to bring) ⇨ **ge**brach**t**
denken (to think) ⇨ **ge**dach**t**

**Past participle of strong verbs**

To form the past participle of a strong verb, you again add **ge** to the beginning of the verb, but add **en** to the end of the stem. As with mixed verbs above, the stem may change when going into the past tense.

lesen (to read) ⇨ **ge**les**en**

fahren (to drive) ⇨ **ge**fahr**en**

essen (to eat) ⇨ **ge**gess**en**

trinken (to drink) ⇨ **ge**trunk**en**

**Putting it all together**

Now you know to use **haben** or **sein** and how to form the **past participle**, you can put it all together to form a sentence in the perfect tense:

I have laughed so much ⇨ Ich **habe** so sehr **gelacht**. (Literal: I have so much laughed.)

I drove home yesterday. ⇨ Ich **bin** gestern nach Hause **gefahren**. (Literal: I am yesterday home driven.)

I have read a great book. ⇨ Ich **habe** ein tolles Buch **gelesen**. (Literal: I have a great book read.)

**A couple of exceptions**

There are a couple of exceptions to look out for. These exceptions exist when the verb in its infinitive form begins with **be**, **ge** or **ver**. When this happens, the beginning of the verb stays the same.

**For example:**
besuchen (to visit): I have visited my grandma last week. ⇨ Ich **habe** letzte Woche meine Oma **besucht**. (Literal: I have last week my grandma visited.)

gewinnen (to win): Tom has won €100. ⇨ Tom **hat** 100€ **gewonnen**. (Literal: Tom has €100 won.)

vergessen (to forget): We’ve forgotten our keys. ⇨ Wir **haben** unsere Schlüssel **vergessen**. (Literal: We have our keys forgotten.)
