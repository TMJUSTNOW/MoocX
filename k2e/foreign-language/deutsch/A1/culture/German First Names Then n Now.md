## German First Names: Then & Now

Guten Tag! Today I thought I’d cover the interesting topic of German Vornamen (first names). When you think of German names, which ones spring immediately to mind? Helga? Hermann? Greta? These are classic examples of stereotypical German names – but are babies still given these names in Germany today? In this post I’ll give the German equivalents of some common English names, and we’ll find out how the most popular German baby names have changed since the 1990s!
