## Richtfest: A German Tradition

Hallo! Wie geht’s? Today I’d like to introduce you to a German tradition called Richtfest. I only learnt about this recently, as my parents are having their roof re-done and my mum said she wanted to get some beers for the builders once the roof is finished, “like they do at a Richtfest”. Naturally, I had to learn more – and now I’d like to tell you all about it, too!

### Das Richtfest – What is it?

Put simply, **Richtfest** is where people who are building a house, or having some major renovations done on their house, give thanks to the builders and all involved in the construction work with a mini-ceremony. People involved include **der Bauherr **– builder,** der Baumeister** – architect/master builder and **der Zimmermann** – carpenter. The **Richtfest** typically occurs when the final beam is added to the roof of the new build.

### What happens at a Richtfest?

A giant wreath called **der Richtkranz** is used to decorate the roof of the house, and a speech or poem known as **der Richtspruch** is spoken to mark the completion of the build and declare the house ‘open’. This speech usually calls upon God to bless and protect the house. The ceremony usually involves a **Prost** (toast) with** Schnaps** or another alcoholic drink.

Here is the first part of a typical **Richtspruch**:

> **Verehrte Gäste**
>
> **Viele Stunden sind vergangen,**
> **seit man das Werk hat angefangen.**
> **Wände stellen, Dachstuhl richten,**
> **all der Zunft gerechten Pflichten.**
> **Es floß der Schweiß bei Sonnenglut,**
> **gelobt sei Gott, es floß kein Blut.**

 

> *Dear guests,*
>
> *Many hours have passed*
> *since we began our work.*
> *Putting up walls, laying the roof,*
> *And all of the duties approved by the guild.*
> *The sweat was flowing in the heat of the sun,*
> *Thank God there was no blood flowing.*

 

This tradition is not unique to Germany; it happens in many countries. In the UK this ceremony is called ‘topping out’.

### The wordy stuff

The word das Richtfest roughly translates to ‘roofing ceremony’ or ‘build celebration’. The word** richt**comes from the verb **aufrichten** – to erect/set up, and **das Fest** is the German word for **celebration.**You may also see das Richtfest under the names **das** **Bauheben**,** das** **Weihefest**,** das** **Hebefest**, or **die****Hebfeier**.
