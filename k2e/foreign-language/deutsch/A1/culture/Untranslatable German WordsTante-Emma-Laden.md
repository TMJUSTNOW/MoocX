## Untranslatable German Words: Tante-Emma-Laden

We all have this *Großmutter *(grandmother), *Onkel *(uncle) or *Tante *(aunt) that complains that all the big *Supermarktk**etten *(supermarket chains) are taking over, and there is no space left on the market for the small shops, *wie es früher mal war *(like it once was back in the day). So as a sign of resistance, *Tante Emma *opened her own little grocery store. That is a *Tante-Emma-Laden*, right? No?

Simply put, a *Tante-Emma-Laden *is a small *Lebensmittelladen *(grocery store). It is a small corner store where you can buy *Lebensmittel *(groceries) and many other products you might need – you will be surprised by the variety of products offered at such a small store! It is much more personable than a large *Supermarkt *such as a German Aldi, Lidl or Rewe (comparable to American Safeway, Walmart or Albertsons).

Literally, *Tante-Emma-Laden *means “Aunt-Emma-Store”. Many of these small *Tante-Emma-Läden *emerged after the Second World War, and were typically run and owned by families. The employees are more likely to help you find what you need. The word *Tante-Emma-Laden*, as these stores are called in everyday language, came from the women who often worked in such stores. During the 1950s, *Emma *was a general term for a maid, or a person giving a helping hand. A *Tante *(aunt) is often – or at least was, back in those days – someone trustworthy you knew. Because the *Tante-Emma-Läden *are usually right in the neighborhood, many shoppers know the shop owner personally. In many cases the women working there fit this perfectly. Or they had many such traits: They were helpful, friendly, personable – just like your aunt Emma!

## **An English Alternative**

In English, one might call this a “mom-and-pop-store” or simply “cornerstore”. In case of a “mom-and-pop-store”, there are the similar kinds of traits in play as in the *Tante-Emma-Laden*. Run by somebody trustworthy, helpful, friendly, personable!

## **Decline**

Unfortunately, the amount of *Tante-Emma-Läden *has been on the decline ever since large *Supermarktketten *spread. However, there is a nostalgic push back to old times, and some new *Tante-Emma-Läden *are opened, and others are preserved!

## **Use**

The use is really simple. Colloquially, you can always use it, no matter the context. In a more formal manner, it makes more sense to refer to it as a *kleiner Lebensmittelgeschäft *(small grocery shop).

Norbert van Tiggelen made a *Gedicht *(poem) about *Tante-Emma-Läden*, which you can read below. I made a translation further below!

*Keinen Kampf um Einkaufswagen,*
*auch kein lautes Kindsgeschrei,*
*Herzblut pochte in Regalen,*
*vom Schnittbrot bis zum Bio-Ei.*

*Auf dem kalten Tresen glänzten,*
*Bonbongläser hoch poliert,*
*fandest keinen launisch Kunden,*
*der sich kalt im Gang verirrt’.*

*Ein Stück Fleischwurst an der Theke,*
*reichte man in Kinderhände,*
*saß das Geld nicht ganz so locker*
*gab’s Kredit bis Monatsende.*

*Wie gern ging ich als kleiner Bub,*
*in diese schmucken Lädchen rein,*
*wo man immer lieb gefragt wurd’,*
*„Bitteschön darf’s noch was sein?“*

*Einkauf an der Straßenecke,*
*stressfrei und in Harmonie,*
*dabei Plaudern mit dem Nachbarn*
*das war pure Nostalgie.*

### **Translation**

No fight over a shopping cart,
Also no children shouting loudly,
Blood sweat and tears in the shelves,
from the sliced bread to the organic egg.

On the cold counter they shone,
well-polished cookie jars,
couldn’t find a moody customer,
Who found himself coldly in the wrong isle.

A piece of sausage at the counter,
was given into children’s hands,
If there was no money left to spare,
you got a credit until the month’s end.

How much I liked to go as a small kid,
into these wonderful little stores,
where I was always asked with a gentle voice,
“Would you like to have anything else?”

Getting groceries at the street corner,
without stress and in harmony,
while chatting with the neighbor,
that was nostalgia, purely.
