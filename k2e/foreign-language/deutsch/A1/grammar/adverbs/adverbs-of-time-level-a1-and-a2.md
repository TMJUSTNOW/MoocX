### Word Order with Adverbs

In English, adverbs can appear in different places within a sentence.

**For example:**
**Tomorrow** is my birthday.
My birthday is **tomorrow**.

Thatâ€™s the same in German.

- Adverbs of time can be placed at the beginning of the sentence.

- **For example:**
  **Heute** fliegen wir nach England. â‡¨ We fly to England today.
  **Morgen** spielen wir FuÃŸball. â‡¨ Weâ€™ll play football tomorrow.

- But this is not fixed.

- **For example:**
  Wir fliegen **heute** nach England.
  Wir spielen **morgen** FuÃŸball.

| ---------------------------------------- |
| **If you start a sentence with an adverb of time the subject (ich, du, erâ€¦) and the verb will swap places. This rule applies to all adverbs.** |
