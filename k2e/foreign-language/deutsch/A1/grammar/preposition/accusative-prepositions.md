# German Accusative Prepositions

### TYPES OF ACCUSATIVE PREPOSITIONS

There are two kinds of accusative prepositions:

1. Those that are always accusative and never anything else. These are already covered - [accusative-3-preposition.md](../../cases/2-accusative/accusative-3-preposition.md).
2. Certain two-way prepositions that can be either accusative or dative, depending on how they are used.



### Two Way Accusative Prepositions

| **Two-Way Prepositions****Accusative/Dative** |                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| The meaning of a two-way preposition often changes based on whether it is used with the accusative or dative case. See below for the grammar rules. |                                |
| **Deutsch**                              | **Englisch**                   |
| **an**                                   | at, on, to                     |
| **auf**                                  | at, to, on, upon               |
| **hinter**                               | behind                         |
| **in**                                   | in, into                       |
| **neben**                                | beside, near, next to          |
| **über**                                 | about, above, across, over     |
| **unter**                                | under, among                   |
| **vor**                                  | in front of, before,ago (time) |
| **zwischen**                             | between                        |

### THE RULES OF TWO-WAY PREPOSITIONS

The basic rule for determining whether a two-way preposition should have an object in the accusative or dative case is motion versus location. If there is motion toward something or to a specific location (wohin?), then usually the object is accusative. If there is no motion at all or random motion going nowhere in particular (*wo?*), then that is usually dative**.** This rule applies only to the so-called two-way or dual prepositions in German. For example, a [dative-only preposition](https://www.thoughtco.com/using-german-dative-prepositions-correctly-1444496) like *nach* is always dative, whether there is motion or not. 

Here are two sets of examples showing motion versus location:

- Accusative: Wir gehen** ins Kino.** (We're going **to the movies**.) There is a motion toward a destination. In this case, that's the movie theater. 
- Dative: Wir sind** im Kino.** (We're **at the movies/cinema**.) We are already at the location and not traveling somewhere. 


- Accusative: Legen Sie das Buch** auf den Tisch.** (Put/Lay the book on the table.) The motion is the placement of the book toward the table.
- Dative: Das Buch liegt **auf dem Tisch.** (The book's lying **on the table.**) The book is already at its destination and not moving.

| All of the accusative prepositions except "entlang," "ohne" and "bis" form what are called "da- compounds" to express what would be a prepositional phrase in English. Da- compounds are not used for people (personal pronouns). Prepositions beginning with a vowel add a connecting r. See the examples below. |                                          |
| **THING**                                | **PERSON**                               |
| **dadurch:** through it, by it           | **durch ihn/sie:** through him/her       |
| **dafür:** for it                        | **für ihn/sie:** for him/her             |
| **dagegen:** against it                  | **gegen ihn/sie:** against him/her       |

|                                          |                                          |

 

### IDIOMS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

A single German two-way preposition, such as *in* or *auf, *may have more than one English translation, as you can see above. In addition, you'll find many of these prepositions have yet another meaning in common everyday idioms and expressions.

Examples: *auf** dem Lande *(in the country), *um **drei** Uhr* (at three o'clock), *unter**uns* (among us), *am Mittwoch* (on Wednesday), *vor** **einer** Woche* (a week ago). Such expressions can be learned as vocabulary without worrying about the grammar involved.
