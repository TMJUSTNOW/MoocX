## What Are the Two "Buts" in German?

Conjunctions are words that link two sentences. In German, they belong to the group of non-declinable words, which means that they never change, no matter what case you think you should use or what gender a following noun has. However, while in English you might only have one option, in German you will often find several possibilities to choose from.  Such is the case with *aber* and *sondern *which your dictionary will most certainly translate both with "but".

Take a look at the following sentences:

1. *The child didn't want to go home, **but** to the park.Das Kind will **nicht** nach Hause gehen, **sondern** zum Park.*
2. *I don't understand what you say, but you will certainly be right.Ich verstehe **nicht**, was Sie sagen, **aber** Sie werden schon Recht haben.*
3. *She is exhausted, **but** doesn't want to go to sleep.Sie ist erschöpft, **aber** will nicht schlafen gehen.*

As you can see, both *aber* and *sondern* mean *but* in English. How do you know which "but" conjunction to use? It is actually quite simple:
*Aber*, which means *but, however* is used after either a positive (1) or negative clause (2).
On the other hand, *sondern* is **only used** after a negative clause when expressing a contradiction. In other words, the first clause of the sentence must contain either [*nicht*](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-position-of-nicht-1444481) or *kein *(3), and the second part of the sentence **must contradict **the first part of the sentence. *Sondern* can be best translated as* but rather*.

### HOW CARUSO'S LITTLE BROTHER HELPS YOU TO CREATE BETTER SENTENCES

One last thing: "aber" as well as "sondern" are so called "ADUSO"-words. ADUSO is an acronym for:

A=aber (but)

D=denn (because)

U=und (and)

S=sondern (contradicting but)

O=oder (or)

Those conjunctions all take position zero in a sentence. To remember that you might want to think of ADUSO as the little brother of [Enrico Caruso, the great opera singer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1QJwHWvgP8).

But he never grew out of his famous brother's shadow and remained quite a **loser**. Imagine the "o" in "loser" as a zero to remember "position zero".

### A LITTLE QUIZ

Let's test your knowledge. Which German version of "but" would you use in the following sentences?

1. Ich komme nicht aus England, _____ aus Schottland.
   *I don't come from England but from Scotland.*
2. *Ich bin hungrig, _____  ich habe keine Zeit etwas zu essen.I am hungry, but I don't have time to eat something.*
3. *Sie spricht drei Sprachen: Englisch, Russisch und Arabisch _____ leider kein Deutsch.She speaks three languages: English, Russian and Arabic but unfortunately no German.*
4. *Wir hätten gerne drei Cheeseburger, _____ ohne Zwiebeln.We would like (to have) three cheeseburgers, but without onions.*
5. *Er hat keinen Kartoffelsalat mitgebracht, _____  Nudelsalat.He didn't bring potato salad, but noodle salad.*
6. *Er hat gesagt, er bringt Kartoffelsalat mit, _____ er hat Nudelsalat mitgebracht.He said, he'd bring potato salad, but he brought noodle salad.*

You will find the answers below but in opposite order to make it a bit more difficult to cheat. Not that you would ever do that, but our eyes are often quicker than our intentions.
