## Interrogative Pronouns

Finally, there are the **interrogative **pronouns, or “question words.” In German they’re sometimes called *W-Wörter*, since they all start with W. Most of them have a direct English equivalent:

| *Warum?*Why? | *Was?*What? | *Wann?*When? | *Wie?*How? |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
|              |             |              |            |

But "where" is a little more complicated:

| *Wo?*Where at? | *Woher?*Where from? | *Wohin?*Where to? |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
|                |                     |                   |

And "who" has a full set of case endings:

| **Nominative** | *Wer?*    | Who?       |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **Accusative** | *Wen?*    | Who(m)?    |
| **Dative**     | *Wem?*    | To who(m)? |
| **Genitive**   | *Wessen?* | Whose?     |

*Wo *can also be added to the beginning of many prepositions to make a question word. If the preposition starts with a vowel, an “r” is inserted between them to make the pronunciation easier:

| **\*Wofür** lebe ich?***What** am I living **for**? | **\*Worüber** sprichst du?***What** are you talking **about**? |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|                                          |                                          |

As you can see, we usually do this using “what” in modern English, but it used to be a more direct equivalent – think of “Romeo, Romeo, **wherefore** [why, what for] art thou Romeo?”

“Which” in German is *welch—* and is fully declined according to gender and case (see [Section II](http://germanforenglishspeakers.com/nouns/declension-tables/)).

As in English, the interrogative pronouns can also sometimes be used as relative pronouns. Unlike the standard relative pronouns in the [previous subsection](http://germanforenglishspeakers.com/pronouns/relative-pronouns/), they are not declined:

*Der Ort, \**wo** ich zur Schule ging, ist nicht weit von hier.*
The place **where** I went to school is not far from here.
