### What is a Separable and Inseparable Verb in German?

A separable verb in German is a verb with a German prefix. A prefix is an additional word such as an (on, to, by) or ein (on) which is added to the beginning of a verb to change its meaning. 

For example: anschauen, einkaufen, umziehen

An inseparable verb follows the same pattern. Only certain prefixes make the verb inseparable. 

For example: bekommen, entdecken, vergessen


### The different prefixes:

There are many words that can be added to a verb to change its meaning and result in a German separable or inseparable verb. 

### The separable prefixes are:

ab-, an-, auf-, aus-, bei-, durch-, ein-, los-, mit-, nach-, her-, hin-, um-, vor-, weg-, zu-, zurück-

### The inseparable prefixes are:

be-, ent-, er-, ge-, hinter-, miss-, über-, ver-, zer-

            I was doing my German homework and needed to know whether the verb “umziehen” was separable. Didn’t expect to find it this fast. Thank you, you helped me a lot! 🙂

        

    


        
        
            Wider- and emp- are also inseperable prefixes, am I right?

        

    


Hi Athlon,
The prefix “emp” is also inseparable. For example:
Ich empfehle Ihnen dieses Hotel.
The prefix “wider” is a double-crosser.
This means that with some main verbs, the prefix is separable, and with other main verbs, the same prefix is inseparable. However generally speaking the prefix “wider” is mainly inseparable. For example:
Ich widerspreche Ihnen.
I hope this helps 🙂
