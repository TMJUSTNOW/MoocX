### DÃ¼sseldorf â€“ A Guide to DÃ¼sseldorf

DÃ¼sseldorf is the capital of the county Nord-Rhein Westfalen but is by far not the biggest city in the county with only 585 000 inhabitants. Thatâ€™s why rivalry between other larger cities is high (So donâ€™t mention Cologne in DÃ¼sseldorf). DÃ¼sseldorf is a very posh and wealthy city with modern architecture. DÃ¼sseldorf is not only the stateâ€™s capital, it is also the fashion capital of Germany. The bar-hopping scene in DÃ¼sseldorf is huge. The city centre (Altstadt) is the longest bar strip in Germany while the bar scene at the redeveloped harbor Medienhafen is growing rapidly too. The biggest event taking place in DÃ¼sseldorf is Carnival. Thousands of people celebrate this event in the city centre of DÃ¼sseldorf.

### Sights:

[](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Medienhafen.jpeg)Medienhafen: The Media Harbour (picture left) is in the south of DÃ¼sseldorf and used to be an industrial area which was not even considered a part of DÃ¼sseldorf. But in 1990 a lot of effort was put in this area to make it nicer and bring people back to the harbour. Itâ€™s now an entertainment area with fancy buildings in which cinemas, restaurants, clubs, bars and stores are located. You can imagine how busy it can get on a Saturday night ðŸ™‚

Schloss Benrath: This castle was built in the 18th century for Elector Carl Theodor and was designed by Frenchman Nicholas de Pigage. The castle is open in summer from 10am â€“ 6pm and in winter from 11am â€“ 5pm. Entrance is â‚¬7 and there are guided tours in German.

Rheinturm: The Rhine Tower is 240 meters high with a revolving restaurant at the top. To go up the tower you have to take the lift which costs â‚¬3.50.
