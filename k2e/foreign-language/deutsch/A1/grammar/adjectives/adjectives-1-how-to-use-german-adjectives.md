# How to use German Adjectives

### Describing the German Adjectives

So, to make sure we’re all on the same page, adjectives are descriptive words like **young, old, beautiful** etc. In German, adjectives change their endings depending on whether the person or thing you are referring to is masculine, feminine or neuter and whether singular or plural. 

#### Some examples

alt - old

schön - beautiful

schnell - quick

It also depends on the case of the person or thing you are describing and whether it’s preceded by the definite or indefinite article. Sound confusing? don’t worry, it’s not as bad as it sounds and if you get it wrong, you will still be understood.

German adjectives come before the noun they describe but when used with a verb it’s placed after the verb.

**For example:**
Die alte Frau (the old lady) ⇨ the adjective **alte** is before the noun **Frau**

Du bist schön. (You are beautiful.) ⇨ the adjective **schön** is after the verb
