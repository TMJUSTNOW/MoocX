## The German Words for the Days of the Week

To begin, here are the seven days of the week in German, linked to an audio of their pronunciations.

### Must-know Grammatical Info About the German Days of the Week

All right, I know I said above that you only had to use seven words, but it’s German, so things are slightly more complicated than that. You also need to know [a few grammatical rules](http://www.fluentu.com/german/blog/german-grammar-rules/), such as:

- **Use am (on) to denote that something is happening on a particular day.**

If you want to say something is happening on Monday, or something happened on Tuesday this week, you only need one little word: **am**. Simply say **\*am Montag** *(on Monday), **am Dienstag** (on Tuesday), etc.

- **The days of the week are usually capitalized, but in some cases they are not.**

Like most German nouns, the days of the week are capitalized—in almost all cases. The one exception: If you want to say that something happens on Mondays generally, or that you go to a specific gym class on Wednesdays, for example, you don’t capitalize the day of the week—but you do add an “s” to make it plural.

So, for example, you could say, *“Ich gehe montags in die Klasse”* (I go to class Mondays).

- **All the days of the week are masculine.**

All days of the week [are masculine](http://www.fluentu.com/german/blog/german-masculine-feminine/), which mean they take masculine articles: **der** (the) and **ein** (a).

- **Use von … bis … to denote “from … to …”**

Want to say “From Monday to Thursday”? You just need two more little words: **von** (from) and **bis** (to).

You can say:

*Von Montag bis Donnerstag, bin ich in Kopenhagen.*
(From Monday to Thursday, I am in Copenhagen.)

Here is the table:

To say "on Monday" or "on Friday" you use the prepositional phrase **am Montag** or **am Freitag**. (The word **am** is actually a contraction of **an** and **dem**, the dative form of **der**. More about that below.) Here are some commonly used phrases for the days of the week:

| **Day Phrases**                          |                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Englisch**                             | **Deutsch**                              |
| on Monday(on Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.)   | **am Montag**(**am Dienstag**, **Mittwoch**, usw.) |
| (on) Mondays(on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, etc.) | **montags**(**dienstags**, **mittwochs**, usw.) |
| every Monday, Mondays(every Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.) | **jeden Montag**(**jeden Dienstag**, **Mittwoch**, usw.) |
| this Tuesday                             | **(am) kommenden Dienstag**              |
| last Wednesday                           | **letzten Mittwoch**                     |
| the Thursday after next                  | **übernächsten Donnerstag**              |
| every other Friday                       | **jeden zweiten Freitag**                |
| Today is Tuesday.                        | **Heute ist Dienstag.**                  |
| Tomorrow is Wednesday.                   | **Morgen ist Mittwoch.**                 |
| Yesterday was Monday.                    | **Gestern war Montag.**                  |
|                                          |                                          |

A few words about the dative case, which is used as the object of certain prepositions (as with dates) and as the indirect object of a verb.

Here we are concentrating on the use of the accusative and dative in expressing dates. Here is a chart of those changes. 

| **NOMINATIV-AKKUSATIV-DATIV**            |               |                   |           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| **GENDER**                               | **Nominativ** | **Akkusativ**     | **Dativ** |
| MASC.                                    | der/jeder     | **den**/**jeden** | **dem**   |
| NEUT.                                    | das           | das               | **dem**   |
| FEM.                                     | die           | die               | **der**   |
| EXAMPLES: **am Dienstag** (on Tuesday, *dative*), **jeden Tag** (every day, *accusative*) |               |                   |           |
| **NOTE:** The masculine (**der**) and neuter (**das**) make the same changes (look the same) in the dative case. Adjectives or numbers used in the dative will have an -**en** ending: **am sechsten April**. |               |                   |           |

Now we want to apply the information in the chart above. When we use the prepositions **an** (on) and **in** (in) with days, months or dates, they take the dative case. Days and months are masculine, so we end up with a combination of **an** or **in** plus **dem**, which equals **am** or **im**. To say "in May" or "in November" you use the prepositional phrase **im Mai** or **im November**.

However, some date expressions that do not use prepositions (**jeden Dienstag**, **letzten Mittwoch**) are in the accusative case.

### Abbreviation

Finally, German days of the week have abbreviations just like English days of the week do. They are:

**Mo**, *Montag *(Mon.)

**Di,** *Dienstag* (Tues.)

**Mi**, *Mittwoch*, (Wed.)

**Do**, *Donnerstag *(Thurs.)

**Fr**, *Freitag *(Fri.)

**Sa**, *Samstag* (Sat.)
