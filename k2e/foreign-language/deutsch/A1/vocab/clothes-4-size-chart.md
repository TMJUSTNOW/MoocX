### CLOTHING SIZE CONVERSION CHART

When it comes to clothing and shoe sizes, Europeans, Americans and the British use very different systems. Not only is there the difference in metric versus English measurements, but there are different philosophies in some areas, especially in children's sizes.

And not even the British and American sizes are always the same.

For children's clothing, Europeans go by height rather than age. For instance, a kid's size 116 in Europe is for a child 114-116 cm (45-46 in) tall. That equals the US/UK "age 6" size, but not all six-year-olds are the same height. When converting children's sizes, you should remember that difference.

See the conversion charts below for more information.
