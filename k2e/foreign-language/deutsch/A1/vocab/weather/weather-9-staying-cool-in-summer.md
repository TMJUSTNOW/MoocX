## 7 Tips on Staying Cool in a Heatwave

Servus! We have around 34 degrees in Munich today, and in England (where I come from) there is also a **Hitzewelle** where it is around 30 – 31 degrees. After melting today at work it gave me the idea to write this post to help you guys with a few tips on how to manage the heat and learn a bit of German at the same time!



To start with, here are some keywords:

**die Hitzewelle**                                              the heatwave
**die Temperatur  **                                          the temperature
**die Sonnencreme**                                         the sun cream
**die Flüssigkeit  **                                             the liquid
**der Grad  **                                        the degree (for example: 31 Grad – 31 degrees)
**trinken  **                                                         to drink
**abkühlen **                                                      to cool off
**die Sonnencreme                                       ** the sun cream

 

**– Trinken Sie genugend Flüssigkeiten!**
Drink enough liquids!

**– Lassen Sie die Vorhänge zu während des Tages**
Leave the curtains closed during the day

**– Füllen Sie eine Wärmflasche mit eiskaltem Wasser auf und legen Sie es in das Bett um besser zu schlafen**
Fill a hot water bottle with ice cold water and put it in your bed to help you sleep better

**– Nehmen Sie ein kaltes Fußbad**
Take a cold footbath

**– Trinken Sie keine eiskalten Getränke oder Alkohol**
Don’t drink ice cold drinks or alcohol (ice cold drinks make your body think you are cold, and actually produces heat! That’s why it’s better to drink drinks at room temperature or even hotter. Alcohol can lead to dehydration which of course won’t help during a heatwave).

**– Nutzen Sie ein Feuchtigkeitsspray**
Use a facial moisture spray

**– Essen Sie lieber öfter und dafür kleinere Mahlzeiten**
Eat smaller meals more often (rather than eating big meals where your digestive system has to work harder, your body will not have to work as hard and therefore won’t produce as much heat with smaller meals, also eating more often will prevent fainting as when it’s hot you usually eat less than normal).

In Germany the room temperature at a work place shouldn’t be over 35 degrees. If the room temperature goes over 35 degrees the employees have the right to move to a room that is cooler, or go home. If the employees go home it is called **Hitzefrei** (literally translates to “heat free”).
