## At A Petrol Station: German Vocab

Obviously, the main word to look out for is **die Tankstelle** – *petrol station.*

The Germans have a verb for the act of filling up your car with petrol: **tanken. **Whereas in English we’d have to say the equivalent of ‘Ich brauche Benzin’ (‘I need to get petrol/gas’) or ‘Ich muss zur Tankstelle’ (‘I need to go to the petrol station’), in German you can simply say **Ich muss tanken.** This comes from the English word **tank.** ‘I need to tank’. I’m not joking when I say that this verb has amused me since childhood – probably because I recognised the mixture of German and English and found it wonderfully simple!

When you head to the** Tankstelle** to do some** tanken**, be sure to know which type of fuel to put into your **Auto** (car):

**Petrol /Gas– das BenzinDiesel – der Diesel**

You may also see Benzin described as **Bleifrei – unleaded**, or as one of the following: **Normal, Super, Super Plus.**

If you’re renting a car (which you’d do from a place called **die Autovermietung**, or **das Mietwagenbüro** – car rental place) and you’re unsure of the exact fuel type your car needs, be sure to ask – or even get them to write it down for you (this information is probably written down somewhere anyway, but just in case you are unsure, you could always ask for clarification):

**Welchen Kraftstoff braucht das Auto?** – Which fuel type does the car use?

**Würden Sie das bitte für mich aufschreiben?** – Would you write that down for me, please?

Better to be safe than sorry.

At the** Tankstelle**, use **die Pumpe** (the pump) to fill your car up, firmly close **der Tankdeckel** (petrol cap cover), note which number **Säule** (pillar) you are at, then go and tell the cashier so you can pay for your fuel. **‘Nummer vier, bitte’** – ‘Number four, please’.

While at a petrol station, you may also want to do the following things:

**die Windschutzscheibe waschen** – Wash the windscreen

**die Autoreifen aufpumpen** **lassen** – Have the tyres pumped up

**Einen Kaffee kaufen** – Buy a coffee (**sehr wichtig** – very important!)
