## Possessive Pronoun

Unfortunately, all the possessive pronouns have different endings in the dative case, too. But, don't worry, all is not lost ;) The pattern here (the endings to be specific) is identical to that which you learned above in the indefinite article table and, furthermore, all the possessive pronouns follow the same pattern.

You just need to add an 'em' to the end of the masculine possessive pronoun, an 'er' to the end of the feminine one and an 'em' again to the end of the neuter one.

| Masculine | Feminine | Neuter  | English translation               |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| meinem    | meiner   | meinem  | my                                |
| deinem    | deiner   | deinem  | your (informal singular)          |
| seinem    | seiner   | seinem  | his                               |
| ihrem     | ihrer    | ihrem   | her                               |
| seinem    | seiner   | seinem  | its                               |
| unserem   | unserer  | unserem | our                               |
| eurem     | eurer    | eurem   | your (informal plural)            |
| Ihrem     | Ihrer    | Ihrem   | your (formal singular and plural) |
| ihrem     | ihrer    | ihrem   | their                             |

Once you have understood how the nominative, accusative and dative cases work, you are now ready to progress to the genitive case.
