# How the German Cases work – Nominative, Accusative, Dative and Genitive

[](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/cases.jpg)

### The German Cases

Right, let’s get stuck into the heart of the German language, the cases. There are four cases in the German language: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive. The cases are an important part of German grammar as they are responsible for the endings of [adjectives](../../810/how-to-use-german-adjectives.html), [indefinite articles](../../2333/the-indefinite-article.html) and when to use which [personal pronoun](../../889/how-german-personal-pronouns-change-with-case.html). Let’s have a closer look below. Learn and enjoy the German language with Jabbalab! 🙂

 

### The Nominative Case

Definite Articleder Manndie Fraudas Haus
Indefinite Articleein Manneine Frauein HausThe nominative case is used for a person, animal or thing which is doing the action. In this case, you will be able to ask: Who/What did or is something? The nominative case is always used after the verbs sein and werden.Example sentences:Der Mann schläft. ⇨ Who sleeps?Die Frau kocht. ⇨ Who cooks?Es ist ein schönes Haus. ⇨ What is beautiful? The Accusative CaseMasculineFeminineNeutral
Example sentences:

Die Frau kocht. ⇨ Who cooks?

Indefinite Articleeinen Manneine Frauein HausThe accusative case is used for a person, animal or thing which is directly affected by the action of the verb. The accusative is also used after certain [prepositions](../../768/how-to-use-german-prepositions.html).Example sentences:Ich sehe den Mann. ⇨ What do I see?Wir haben die Torte gegessen. ⇨ What have we eaten?Er hat ein Foto gemacht. ⇨ What has he made?You can see that the noun in the sentence here is always directly affected by the verb. The Dative CaseMasculineFeminineNeutral
Example sentences:

Wir haben die Torte gegessen. ⇨ What have we eaten?

You can see that the noun in the sentence here is always directly affected by the verb.
Definite Articledem Mannder Fraudem Haus
Indefinite Articleeinem Manneiner Fraueinem HausThe dative case is used to show the indirect object of a verb. An indirect object is a person, animal or a thing the action is intended to benefit or harm. You are able to ask: Who to/for or to/for what? In most situations you can also ask whom. The dative case is also used after certain [prepositions](../../768/how-to-use-german-prepositions.html).Example sentences:Ich gab der Frau einen Apfel. ⇨ Who did I give an Apple to?Er hilft dem Mann beim Putzen. ⇨ Whom did he help to clean?Er gibt einem Mädchen einen Kuss. ⇨ Who did he give a kiss to? The Genitive CaseMasculineFeminineNeutral
Example sentences:

Er hilft dem Mann beim Putzen. ⇨ Whom did he help to clean?

 
Definite Articledes Mannesder Fraudes Hauses
Indefinite Articleeines Manneseiner Fraueines Hauses
des Lehrersdes Mädchens

The genitive case is used to show, that something belongs to someone. You’re able to ask: Whose…? The genitive case is also used after certain [prepositions](../../768/how-to-use-german-prepositions.html).

Note:

–s is added to masculine and neuter nouns ending in: en, el or er.

e.g. der Lehrer → des Lehrers

e.g. der Geldbeutel → des Geldbeutels

e.g. das Eisen → des Eisens  

–es is added to the most masculine and neuter nouns of one syllable ending in a consonant.

e.g. der Mann → des Mannes

e.g. das Pferd → des Pferdes
Example sentences:

Das Haus der Frau ist blau. ⇨ Whose house is blue?

Das Auto des Mannes ist schwarz. ⇨ Whose car is black?

Das Hufeisen des Pferdes ist kaputt. ⇨ Whose horseshoe is broken?

Die Farbe des Geldbeutels ist braun. ⇨ Whose colour is brown?

Das Auto des Lehrers ist grün. ⇨ Whose car is green?

Die Tasche des Mädchens ist gelb. ⇨ Whose bag is yellow?

Das ist die Telefonnummer einer Freundin. ⇨ Whose telephone number is that?

                    


        
        
            I have a book that teaches the cases and I haven’t gotten to the genetive case yet. From this blog, it looks easier than I thought it would be!

        

    


        
        
            The cases have always thrown me but this is the best explanation yet of how they work.

        

    


        
        
            Thanks Anji 😀

        

    


        
        
            So many books and websites either give terrible explanations or fail completely to explain WHEN to use the cases. Lots of examples combined with clear explanations have helped me to put the puzzle pieces together – finally! Thanks a lot!

        

    


        
        
            Thanks Claire 😀

        

    


        
        
            Great !! A lot easier way !!

        

    


Danke…
Its a very simble way to learn gramer
thanks



        
        
            Thanks!!! Very well explained with great attention to detail 🙂

        

    


        
        
            wow very well explanation ….. helped me to clear all the fundas…..thank you so so much …

        

    


        
        
            Seriously, thank you. I’ve studied German in high school and am trying to self study now, and this is really the best and clearest explanation of the different cases I’ve come across. =)

        

    


        
        
            Das regel am Ende “s is added to masculine and neuter nouns ending in: en, el or er.” ist neu für mich

        

    


        
        
            Hello Amr,
Yes that’s correct. But only in the genitive case 🙂

        

    


        
        
            Thank you for this easy to follow explanation! I teach level 1 and 2 German privately and the books we use are from Langenscheidt the Genial series, but my high school students still find the cases hard to grasp.

        

    


        
        
            what I have learnt ten years back it is all recalling the way these deutsch lesen ist

        

    


        
        
            wow! i agreed even before i read the comments – this is the best explanation of the cases i’ve seen anywhere! thank you!

        

    


Wow! This is the hardest part of German for me and you’ve described it clearly, out of all of the books I have bought this is by far the best I have seen!
Thanks so much!!



        
        
            I have never focused on anything grammar-related because I felt as though it came naturally. However, now that I am taking college-level German courses I don’t understand anything and it is really making things difficult. This definition cleared everything up and answered all of my questions really well. Thank you!!!

        

    


        
        
            Absolutely brilliant!. Thanks

        

    


        
        
            thank you !!!! i never comment on anything but this was such a helpful tool

        

    


thank you very much !
i have my final exams in german after a few hours !
this has helped me a lot !
thank you once again 🙂



        
        
            thankyew so much..!! this was the easiest way to understand it.. 🙂

        

    


        
        
            I agree with the previous comments, this is by far the best explanation. I have taken the same topic in different courses in different times and places and was never able to find something that didn’t look like a complex equation. Finally someone could lay it down in a way that you can remember naturally.

        

    


        
        
            Probably the most helpful page I’ve come across in helping me learn German. The cases, genders, declensions, and everything about German confuse me no end, so while I can’t say I’ve memorised this page (yet), I’ve bookmarked it for future reference.
Thanks for a great article, very helpful. 🙂

        

    


        
        
            I love this explanation! Thank you soooooo much!!!

        

    


        
        
            Thank you! Bookmarked, and re-read several times!! I really appreciate you.

        

    


        
        
            Vielen Dank!! You have perfectly given me all I have been looking for concerning cases and inflections. Excellent work(It must have taken you a lot of time and effort). May God bless you heavily. Am in Uganda.

        

    


        
        
            Thanx a lot for simplifying the complex German grammar.

        

    


        
        
            Thank you so much.  I studied German grammar some years ago, and never understood the four cases at all.  I am studying again, and still have trouble because the German teacher only explained the endings for ‘the’ and ‘a/an’, not why.  This explanation is great, much easier to understand.

        

    


        
        
            THNX YOU  VERY MUCH  THIS IS REALLY CLEAR EXPLANTION I ALWAYS CONFUSE OTHER WEB SITES

        

    


        
        
            Thank you so much. You’ve aided my understanding of the German Language. What a simple way to teach a beginner!

        

    


        
        
            great job,but i want to know more about  suffixes,what about the adding of suffixes in plural,can anyone ilustrate me with any example.I wolud be very grateful.:)

        

    


        
        
            Hi Mr. Football,
We have a dedicated blog about this topic. Here is the link ⇨ [http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/2903/the-german-articles-der-die-and-das-with-video](../../2903/the-german-articles-der-die-and-das-with-video.html)
I hope this helps 🙂

        

    


Danke…..
Ich bin learne!
I hope that’s correct



        
        
            Hi Ariela, 
It’s just: Ich lerne. In English you would say I’m learning but this time form doesn’t exist in German. You use the normal present tense instead. It would be worth to read our blog about the -ing trap. The link is here ⇨ [http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/901/the-german-present-tense-and-the-ing-trap](../../901/the-german-present-tense-and-the-ing-trap.html)
I hope this helps 🙂

        

    


I really appreciate your explanation of the cases. They are certainly clearer for me now.
Just an aside: for the explanation under the Dative Case I think it would be more correct to say to/for whom, instead of who to/for.



        
        
            Hi Lissa,
Technically ‘To whom did I give an apple?’ is correct – but realistically you’d never say this phrase, it’s so old fashioned and people don’t really use it anymore. But I’ve added it now to make it even easier to identify the dative case. Thanks 🙂

        

    


        
        
            Crystal Clear 🙂

        

    


        
        
            It was never so clear … great job author 🙂

        

    


Danke!!!1
so clear explanation, finally i’ll score gud in my exams



        
        
            The best explanation I’ve ever read! Congratulations, it really helped me to understand how German articles work!

        

    


        
        
            Very clear. Unlike the other cases, I think the genetive is easy to remember when to use. I think of it as the possessive, and expressed in English with “‘s”, for example in “My husband’s dog”, “my friend’s mother” etc.

        

    


        
        
            Very clean article. Perfect way of explanation. Thanks a lot!

        

    


        
        
            Thank you  so much…..its very easy n clear to understand …

        

    


        
        
            it was grt reading this  I am IMPRESSED

        

    


        
        
            The explanation of all cases is really good.Now i dnt hv ayn kind of problem with the German cases.thanks a lot.

        

    


        
        
            After one-time reading I understood the difficult cases, before reading this, it has such a simplicity and clearness, great great job.

        

    


        
        
            Das ist sehr klar…vielen dank

        

    


        
        
            wow thnk u soooomuch .you just broke everthing in pieces to my understanding

        

    


        
        
            if you can further elaborate or provide a table with “ending in: en, el or er”, it will be fabulous.
