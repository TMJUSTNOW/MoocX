# 4 German Noun Cases

For native English speakers, one of the most challenging aspects of learning German, at least initially, can be the fact that each noun, pronoun and article has four cases. Yes, not only does every noun have a gender, but that gender also has four different variations, depending on where it lands in a sentence. 

Depending on how a given word is used — whether it's the subject, a possessive, an indirect or a direct object — the spelling and the pronunciation of that noun or pronoun changes, as does the preceding article.

The four German cases are the nominative, the genitive, the dative and the accusative. You can think of these as the subject, possessive, indirect object and direct object in English.



### THE GERMAN NOMINATIVE CASE ( *DER NOMINATIV* OR *DER WERFALL*)

The nominative case—in both German and in English—is the subject of a sentence. The term nominative comes from Latin and means to name (think of "nominate"). Amusingly, *der Werfall* translates literally as "the **who** case."

The nominative case is used for a person, animal or thing which is doing the action. In this case, you will be able to ask: **Who/What** did or is something? The nominative case is always used after the verbs **sein** and **werden.**

In the examples below, the nominative word or expression is in bold:

- **\*Der Hund **beißt den Mann.* (The dog bites the man.)
- **\*Dieser Gedanke **ist blöd**.** *(This thought is stupid.)
- **\*Meine Mutter **ist **Architektin***\*.*** (My mother is an architect.)
- Der Mann schläft. ⇨ **Who** sleeps?
- Die Frau kocht. ⇨ **Who** cooks?
- Es ist ein schönes Haus. ⇨ **What** is beautiful?

The nominative case can follow the verb "to be," as in the last example. The verb "is" acts like an equal sign (my mother = architect). But the nominative is most often the subject of a sentence.

Articles in the nominative form:

| Gender  | Definite | Indefinite | Plural |
| ------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Male    | der      | ein        | die    |
| Female  | die      | eine       | die    |
| Neutral | das      | ein        | die    |

### THE GENITIVE (DER GENITIV OR DER WESFALL)

The genitive case in German shows possession. 

In English, this is expressed by the possessive "of" or an apostrophe with an "s" ('s).

The genitive case is also used with some verb idioms and with the [genitive prepositions](https://www.thoughtco.com/german-prepositions-in-the-genitive-case-4065381). The genitive is used more frequently in written German than in spoken form — it's essentially the equivalent of English speakers using the word "whose" or "whom." In spoken, everyday German, *von* plus the dative often replaces the genitive.

For example: 

*Das Auto von **meinem** Bruder.* (My brother's car or literally, the car from/of my brother.)

Articles in the genitive form:

Articles in the nominative form:

| Gender  | Definite            | Indefinite | Plural |
| ------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Male    | des e.g. des Hundes | eines      | der    |
| Female  | der e.g. der Katze  | einer      | der    |
| Neutral | des eg. des Pferdes | eines      | der    |

The male and neutral nouns are added with -s or -es while female noun stays the same.

You can tell that a noun is in the genitive case by the article, which changes to *des/**eines** *(for masculine and neuter) or *der/**einer* (for feminine and plural). Since the genitive only has two forms *(des* or *der*), you only need to learn those two. However, in the masculine and neuter, there is also an additional noun ending, either -es or -s. In the examples below, the genitive word or expression is in bold.

- *das Auto ***meines Bruders  (my brother's **car or the car **of my brother)**
- *die **Bluse*** des Mädchens (the girl's **blouse or the blouse **of the girl**)
- *der Titel \**des Filmes/****Films***  (**the film's** title or the title **of the film)**

Feminine and plural nouns do not add an ending in the genitive. The feminine genitive (*der/**einer*) is identical to the feminine dative. The one-word genitive article usually translates as two words (of the or of a/an) in English.

### THE DATIVE CASE (*DER DATIV OR DER WEMFALL*)

The dative case is used to show the **indirect** object of a verb. An indirect object is a person, animal or a thing the action is intended to benefit or harm. You are able to ask: **Who to/for** or **to/for what?** In most situations you can also ask **whom**. The dative case is also used after certain [prepositions](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/768/how-to-use-german-prepositions).

The dative case is a vital element of communicating in German. In English, the dative case is known as the indirect object. Unlike the accusative, which only changes with the masculine gender, the dative changes in all genders and even in the plural. It is answered for the object - whom.

The pronouns also change correspondingly.

Articles in the dative case:

| Gender  | Definite | Indefinite | Plural |
| ------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Male    | dem      | einem      | den    |
| Female  | der      | einer      | den    |
| Neutral | dem      | einem      | den    |

In addition to its function as the indirect object, the dative is also used after certain [dative verbs](https://www.thoughtco.com/frequently-used-german-dative-verbs-4071410) and with [dative prepositions](https://www.thoughtco.com/using-german-dative-prepositions-correctly-1444496). In the examples below, the dative word or expression is in bold.

- *Der Polizist **gibt** \**dem Fahrer** **einen** Strafzettel.*** (**The policeman is giving **the driver** a ticket.)
- *Ich **danke***\* Ihnen**.* (I thank **you.**)
- *Wir **machen** das **mit** ***einem****\* Computer**. (*We do that with** a computer.)**

The indirect object (dative) is usually the receiver of the direct object (accusative). In the first example above, the driver got the ticket. Often, the dative can be identified by adding a "to" in the translation, such as "the policeman gives the ticket **to** the driver." 

The question word in the dative is, naturally enough, *wem* ([to] whom?). For example: 

*Wem hast du das Buch **gegeben**? (*To whom did you give the book?)

The vernacular in English is, of course, "Who'd you give the book to?" Note that the Germanic word for the dative case, *der **Wemfall**, *also reflects the *der*-to-*dem* change.

### THE ACCUSATIVE CASE (*DER AKKUSATIV* OR *DER **WENFALL*)

If you misuse the accusative case in German, you might say something that would sound like "him has the book" or "her saw he yesterday" in English. It's not just some esoteric grammar point; it impacts whether or not people will understand your German (and whether you'll understand them).

The accusative case is used for a person, animal or thing which is **directly** affected by the action of the verb. The accusative is also used after certain [prepositions](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/768/how-to-use-german-prepositions).

In English, the accusative case is known as the objective case (direct object).

Articles in the accusative case:

| Gender  | Definite | Indefinite | Plural |
| ------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Male    | den      | einen      | die    |
| Female  | die      | eine       | die    |
| Neutral | das      | ein        | die    |

In German, the masculine singular articles *der* and *ein* change to *den* and *einen* in the accusative case. The feminine, neuter and plural articles do not change. The masculine pronoun *er* (he) changes to *ihn* (him), in much the same way as it does in English. In the examples below, the accusative (direct object) noun and pronoun are in** **bold:

- *Der Hund beißt \**den Mann.** *(The dog bites **the man**.)
- *Er beißt ihn.* (He [the dog] bites **him [the man]**.)
- **\*Den Mann **beißt der Hund**.*** (The dog bites **the man**.)
- *Beißt der Hund \**den Mann?*** (Is the dog biting **the man**?)
- *Beißt \**den Mann **der Hund?* (Is the dog biting **the man**?)
- Ich sehe den Mann. ⇨ What do I see?
- Wir haben die Torte gegessen. ⇨ What have we eaten?
- Er hat ein Foto gemacht. ⇨ What has he made?

Notice how the order of the words may change, but as long as you have the proper accusative articles, the meaning remains clear. 

The direct object (accusative) functions as the receiver of the action of a transitive verb. In the examples above, the man is acted upon by the dog, i.e., receives the action of the subject (the dog). To give a few more transitive verb examples, when you buy (*kaufen*) something or have (*haben*) something, the "something" is the direct object. The subject (the person buying or having) is acting on that object.

You can test for a transitive verb by saying it without an object. If it sounds odd and seems to need an object to sound right, then it is probably a transitive verb. Example: *Ich habe *(I have)* or **Er kaufte *(he bought)*.* Both of these phrases answer the implied question "what?" What do you have?

What did he buy? And whatever that is, is the direct object and should be in the accusative case in German.

On the other hand, if you do this with an intransitive verb, such as "to sleep," "to die" or "to wait," no direct object is needed. You can't "sleep," "die" or "wait" something. 

Two apparent exceptions to this test, become and be, are actually not exceptions, since they are intransitive verbs that act like an equal sign and cannot take an object. A good additional clue in German: All verbs that take the helping verb *sein* (to be) are intransitive. 

Some verbs in English and German can be either transitive or intransitive, but the key is to remember that if you have a direct object, you'll have the accusative case in German.

The Germanic word for the accusative case,* der **Wenfall*, reflects the  *der*-to-*den* change. The question word in the accusative is, naturally enough,  *wen* (whom).  *Wen hast du **gestern** **gesehen**? *( Whom did you see yesterday?)

### ACCUSATIVE TIME EXPRESSIONS

The accusative is used in some standard time and distance expressions.

- *Das Hotel **liegt** ***einen****\* Kilometer** von **hier**.* (The hotel lies/is located a kilometer from here.)
- *Er** **verbrachte** ***einen****\* Monat **in Paris.* (He spent a month in Paris.)

### GERMAN CASES ALLOW FLEXIBILITY IN WORD ORDER

Since English articles do not change depending where in the sentence they appear (below, *der* indicates a masculine subject, whereas *den* indicates a masculine direct object), the language relies on word order to clarify which word is the subject and which is the object.

For example, if you say "The man bites the dog" in English, rather than "The dog bites the man," you change the meaning of the sentence completely. In German, however, the word order can be changed for emphasis (as below), without altering the basic action or meaning.

- *Beißt der Hund \**den Mann?*** Is the dog biting **the man**?
- *Beißt \**den Mann **der Hund? *Is the dog biting **the man**?

### DEFINITE AND INDEFINITE ARTICLES

The following charts show the four cases with the definite article (*der, die, das)* the  indefinite article.

Note: *Keine* is the negative of *eine*, which has no plural form. But *keine* (no/none) can be used in the plural. For example: 

- *Er hat \**keine**** Bücher.* (He has no books.)
- *In Venedig gibt es \**keine**** Autos.* (In Venice there are no cars.)

| **Definite Articles** (the)    |                       |                    |                      |                    |

| *Akk*                          | **den**               | **das**            | **die**              | **die**            |
| *Dat*                          | **dem**               | **dem**            | **der**              | **den**            |
| *Gen*                          | **des**               | **des**            | **der**              | **der**            |
| **Indefinite Articles** (a/an) |                       |                    |                      |                    |
| **Fall**Case                   | **Männlich**Masculine | **Sächlich**Neuter | **Weiblich**Feminine | **Mehrzahl**Plural |
| *Nom*                          | **ein**               | **ein**            | **eine**             | **keine**          |
| *Akk*                          | **einen**             | **ein**            | **eine**             | **keine**          |
| *Dat*                          | **einem**             | **einem**          | **einer**            | **keinen**         |
| *Gen*                          | **eines**             | **eines**          | **einer**            | **keiner**         |
|                                |                       |                    |                      |                    |

### DECLINING GERMAN PRONOUNS

German pronouns also take on different forms (i.e. are "declined") in the various cases. Just as nominative "I" changes to the object "me" in English, the German nominative *ich* changes to accusative *mich* in German.

In the following German-English examples, the pronouns change according to their function in the sentence and are indicated in** **bold.

- **\*Er **(der Hund) beißt **den** Mann*. (**He** [the dog] bites the man.)
- **\*Ihn **(den Mann) hat der Hund gebissen.* (The dog bit **him **[the man.])
- **\*Wen **hat er gebissen?* (**Whom **did he bite?)
- **\*Wer** ist das? *( **Who** is that?)
- **\*Du **hast** mich ****doch** **gesehen**?*** **(**You **did see **me** [didn't you?])
- **\*Die **hat **keine** Ahnung.*** **(**She/That one** has no idea.)

Most of the German personal pronouns have different forms in each of the four cases, but it can be helpful to observe that not all change (this is similar to the English "you," which remains the same whether it's subject or object, singular or plural).

Examples in German are *sie* (she), *sie* (they) and the formal form of "you," *Sie*, which is capitalized in all forms. This pronoun, regardless of its meaning, remains the same in the nominative and accusative cases. In the dative, it changes to *ihnen/Ihnen*, while the possessive form is *ihr/Ihr*.

Two German pronouns use the same form in both the accusative and the dative (*uns, euch*). The third-person pronouns (he, she, it) follow the rule that only the masculine gender shows any change in the accusative case. Neither neuter *es* nor feminine *sie *changes. But in the dative case, all of the pronouns take on uniquely dative forms.

The following chart shows the personal pronouns in all four cases. Changes from the nominative (subject) case are indicated in bold.

| **Third-Person Pronouns** (er, sie, es)  |                    |                                     |                    |                    |

| *Note: The possessive (genitive) third-person pronoun forms shown here do not indicate the various additional case endings they might have in a typical sentence in various situations (i.e., *seiner, ihres, *etc.). |                    |                                     |                    |                    |
