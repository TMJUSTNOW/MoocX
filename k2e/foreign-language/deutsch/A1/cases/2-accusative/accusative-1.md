## The Accusative Case

**What is the subject of a sentence?**
The **subject** of a sentence is the person or thing that is “doing” the verb. To find the subject, look for the verb and ask “Who or what is doing?” (substitute the verb for “doing” -- Who or what is singing? Who or what is sleeping?) Subjects are always in the NOMINATIVE CASE.

**What is the direct object of a sentence?**
The **direct object** receives the action of the verb. To find the direct object, look for the verb and ask “Who or what is being verbed?” (as in Who or what is being kicked? Who or what is being read?) Direct objects take the ACCUSATIVE CASE.

Accusative case is 2nd case in German. (Some people say its fourth)



In English the articles “the”, “a” and “an” do not change depending on whether the noun is accusative or nominative. (Only pronouns change case in English: compare “She sees me” and “I see her”.)

In German not only the personal pronouns but also many other words change their form based on case. The articles (*der, ein, kein,* etc.), possessive adjectives (*mein, dein,* etc.), and a few (unusual) nouns all change their form (usually by adding or changing endings) depending on what case they are in.

### Accusative Article

| Article Type                             | Masculine OR männlich     | Feminine OR weiblich     | Neutral OR sächlich       | Plural                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Definite Article OR bestimmter Artikel** | Ich sehe **den** Tisch.   | Ich sehe **die** Lampe.  | Ich sehe **das** Fenster. | Ich sehe **die** Bücher.   |
| **Indefinite and Negativ Artikel**       | Ich habe **einen** Tisch. | Ich habe **eine** Lampe. | Ich habe **ein** Fenster. | Ich habe **keine** Bücher. |

So, this is same as nominative, only the masculine form ends with en, instead of er for definite and indefinite article.

The accusative case is used for a person, animal or thing which is **directly** affected by the action of the verb. The accusative is also used after certain [prepositions](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/768/how-to-use-german-prepositions).

**Example sentences:**

Ich sehe den Mann. ⇨ What do I see?

Wir haben die Torte gegessen. ⇨ What have we eaten?

Er hat ein Foto gemacht. ⇨ What has he made?

You can see that the noun in the sentence here is always directly affected by the verb.
