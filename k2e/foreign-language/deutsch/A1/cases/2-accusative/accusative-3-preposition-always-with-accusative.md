# German Accusative Prepositions

In German, prepositions can be followed by nouns in various cases. An accusative preposition will always be followed by an object (a noun or pronoun) in the[ accusative case](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-four-german-noun-cases-4064290). 

### Prepositions and the Cases

German prepositions break down into **four groups**. Some of them use the **accusative** and some use the **dative** or **genitive** case. On top of this, there are also some that can be either **accusative or dative**, depending on the context of the sentence. When using a preposition, the article of the noun may change depending on the gender and case.

### TYPES OF ACCUSATIVE PREPOSITIONS

There are two kinds of accusative prepositions:

1. Those that are always accusative and never anything else. These are already covered - [accusative-3-preposition.md](../../cases/2-accusative/accusative-3-preposition.md).
2. Certain two-way prepositions that can be either accusative or dative, depending on how they are used.

### Accusative Prepositions

There are **six** prepositions which are strictly linked to the accusative case. Let’s have a look at a table that shows you the prepositions in connection with the definite article der, die and das:

| Preposition                              | Masculine | Feminine  | Neuter     |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| bis (until, till)                        | bis den   | bis die   | bis das    |
| durch (through, by)                      | durch den | durch die | **durchs** |
| für (for)                                | für den   | für die   | **fürs**   |
| gegen (against, for)                     | gegen den | gegen die | gegen das  |
| ohne (without)                           | ohne den  | ohne die  | ohne das   |
| um (around, for, at)                     | um den    | um die    | **ums**    |
| Note: The German preposition *bis* is technically an accusative preposition, but it is almost always used with a second preposition (*bis zu, bis auf*) in a different case, or without an article (*bis April, bis Montag, bis Bonn*). |           |           |            |

As these prepositions are followed by the accusative case the masculine article **der** will change to **den**. After a few German accusative prepositions, a shortened form of the definite article can be merged with the preposition to make one word:

durch + das = **durchs**
für + das = **fürs**
um + das = **ums**

**Example sentences:**
**Bis** nächst**en** Sonntag! ⇨ Until next Sunday!
Wir laufen **durch den** Park. ⇨ We are walking through the park.
Vielen Dank **für die** Auskunft. ⇨ Thank you very much for the advice.
Das Geschenk ist **für den** Mann. ⇨ The present is for the man.
Ich stellte das Fahrrad **gegen die** Wand. ⇨ I put the bike against the wall.
Ich spiele **gegen dich**. ⇨ I play against you.
Gehst du **ohne mich**? ⇨ Do you go without me?
Der Bahnhof ist gleich **um die** Ecke. ⇨ The train station is around the corner.

As you can see, some articles, pronouns and adjectives change their form in the accusative case. You can fresh your memory up by reading our blog [How the German Cases work](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/795/how-the-german-cases-work-nominative-accusative-dative-and-genitive).

### One more preposition

**entlang**( along, down)
Note: The accusative preposition *entlang *usually goes after its object.

### Memorizing

It is hard to remember, so this say can help:

> "Bis, durch, für, gegen, ohne, um, 
> kennst du nicht den Akkusativ? Dann bist du wirklich dumm!"

;)

If you don't know the prepositions - Bis, durch, für, gegen, ohne, um, you don't know the accusative and you are dumb. It is not offending, but "um" and "dumm" rhyme.

Another way to learn - dogfub:

- **d**urch
- **o**hne
- **g**egen
- **f**ür
- **u**m
- **B**is
