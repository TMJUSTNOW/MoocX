Did you notice the many similarities between German and English words!

## Extra Letters

The dots above the extra letters **ä, ö** and **ü** create a sharper sound, made more in the front of your mouth. These are called **“Umlaute”**. You don’t have to decide whether to put dots on these vowels, these come standard with certain words. They can also be written as **ae, oe**, and **ue,** but this is less common.

This unusual looking letter** ß**, which looks like a B is called “**esszett**” and is another symbol for a double ss. The** ß** produces a sharp s- sound like the hissing of a snake as in “**Ich heiße**”, *“I’m called”*. There are no words that start with** ß**, so you will only ever come across it in lower case.
