# Commands in German – der Imperative

### What is a Command in German – Imperative?

An Imperative is used when giving commands, orders or instructions like **“Shut up!”** or **“Help me!”** In these cases the verb will be formed in a special way.

### The three different forms of the German imperative:

There are three ways of giving commands in German by using the German imperative. When to use which form depends on who you are talking to. It could be either:

1. **Informal Command (Singular)**– the informal **“du”** form if you are talking to a person which you know well
2. **Informal Command (Plural)** – the informal **“ihr”** form if you are talking to more than one person which you know well
3. **Formal command** – the formal **“Sie”** form if you are talking to one or more than one person which you don’t know very well

### Forming the German imperative:

|                                      | **Form of Imperative**              | **Verb Example** | **Translation** |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| **du (singular)**                    | verb stem (+e)                      | mach(e)!         | make!           |
| **ihr (plural)**                     | verb stem + t                       | macht!           | make!           |
| **Sie (polite singular and plural)** | verb stem + en i.e. infinitive form | machen Sie!      | make!           |

As you can see from the table above, the pronouns **du** and **ihr** are dropped, leaving only the verb itself when using the imperative in German. The only time when the pronoun still appears is when using the **Sie **form.

### Examples - Seeing them case by case

**1. Formal Command**

This is the imperative that we learned in Chapter One, the Sie-command. When you address one OR several people in a formal manner, you must use this form. The verb takes the -en ending of the *Sie* form, and the pronoun *Sie* is always placed immediately after the verb, exactly as in an interrogative sentence.

Nehmen Sie das Buch!   *Take the book!*

Kaufen Sie es!                 *Buy it!*

Backen Sie einen Kuchen   Bake a cake

**2. Familiar Command - Singular**

When you are on a *du* basis with someone, the familiar singular command is used. This command is formed by removing the -st ending from the present tense of the *du* form, which leaves just the basic stem. The personal pronoun is not used -- just the verb itself.

| komm!                    | *come!*  |
| ------------------------ | -------- |
| geh!                     | *go!*    |
| trink!                   | *drink!* |
| öffne (from du  öffnest) | open     |

Note: verbs that end in a -t or -d, or a consonant cluster like -fn, retain the additional -e- that was added to facilitate pronunciation:

| antworte! | *answer!* |
| --------- | --------- |
| rede!     | *speak!*  |
| öffne!    | *open!*   |

You may also see an -e ending on other verbs in the command form, especially in conversational German, but it’s optional and technically should only be added to verbs with a -t, -d or consonant cluster ending.

Note on **stem-changing** verbs: verbs that have a vowel change from e > i or e > ie retain this change in the familiar singular command.

| iss!  | *eat!*  |
| ----- | ------- |
| gib!  | *give!* |
| sieh! | *look!* |

However, verbs whose stem vowel changes from a > ä do not retain this change in the imperative.

| fahr! | *drive!* |
| ----- | -------- |
| lauf! | *run!*   |

**3. Familiar Command - Plural**

When you address several persons with whom you are on a *du* basis, the familiar plural command is used. This command has exactly the same form as the *ihr* conjugation, with the personal pronoun dropped.

| kauft!     | *buy!*    |
| ---------- | --------- |
| antwortet! | *answer!* |
| lernt!     | *study!*  |
| esst!      | *eat!*    |

This is the easiest of the command forms, since it is exactly the same as the conjugated *ihr*-form, just without the pronoun!

**4. Mild Commands**

When expressing the form “let us” (let’s eat!) the first person plural *(wir)* with an inverted word order is used.

| Gehen wir jetzt! | *Let’s go now!* |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
|                  |                 |

**5. Command forms of SEIN**

The command forms of *sein* are slightly irregular: the *Sie* and *wir* forms are different than you would expect. The command forms for “be!” are:

Seien Sie!Sei!Seid!Seien wir!

Note on **separable-prefix** verbs: if there is a separable prefix attached to the verb, it functions in the normal manner and appears after the command form. This holds true for all command forms *(Sie, ihr, du, wir)*:

Steh auf!*Stand up!*Kommen Sie bitte mit!*Come along, please!*





fang(e)! – catch
fangt! – catch
fangen Sie! – catch

komm(e)! – come
kommt – come
kommen Sie! – come

With the du form, the last **-e** of the verb is usually dropped. There are of course exceptions, but these are very rare. For example, when the stem of the verb ends in **chn-** or **fn-** or **tm-** the **-e** is kept to make the pronunciation easier.

Remember that sometimes the **du** form of a verb can have a vowel change. In these cases, the imperative in German will also have a vowel change.

**For example:**
lesen (to read): du liest – lies!
essen (to eat): du isst – iss!

**BUT** if there is a vowel change which involves an umlaut, this umlaut is not added to the **du** form in the imperative.

**For example:**
schlafen (to sleep): du schläfst – schlaf!
fahren (to drive): du fährst – fahr!

The German imperative is important to get to grips with. Being able to give commands in German is a key step in learning the German language.
