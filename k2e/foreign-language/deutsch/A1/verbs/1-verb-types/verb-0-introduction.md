## Overview of Verb Types

Verb denote the action in the sentence.

In order to be able to speak and understand German you need to know a
 little bit more than just basic phrases and expressions. The basis of 
each sentence is a verb. It bears the most meaning in most cases unless 
it is an auxiliary verb (sein (to be), haben (to have) and some more 
that we will learn later). Most of the verbs in German are regular. It 
means that their conjugation follows a standard pattern that we will 
learn today.

We will start with Present Simple Tense (Präsens). There is nothing 
complicated about that. You take the verb’s stem and add a personal 
ending to that. 

Verb has many forms - infinitive, stem.

**Infinitive** - German verbs always end in *–n* in their infinitive form, usually *–en*:

- *kaufen* - to buy
- *arbeiten* - to work
- *helfen* - to help
- *fliegen* - to fly

**Stem: **You might have noticed that most verbs in German end with –en (i.e. heißen). Anything before that –en is the verb’s stem. 

**Ending: **In English we will only add the ending –s when in the 3rd person. See, **I play** but **he/she plays.** In German verbs will get endings in all persons. Good news is that the pattern is pretty simple and same endings would apply to irregular verbs, too. Though there are some other things you will have to pay attention to with irregular verbs. But that’s later.** **For now let’s stick to regular verbs and their conjugation.
