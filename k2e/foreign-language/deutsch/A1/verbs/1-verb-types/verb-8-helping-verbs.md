### [Helping Verbs]()

There are a handful of verbs that can be used on their own, but which are commonly used to produce other "tenses" or "moods", and we call these *helping verbs*. They fall into three—related!—categories:

1. haben and sein (used to form past tenses)
2. werden (used to form the future and the subjunctive, and to form the passive)
3. modal verbs (können, wollten, sollen, dürfen, mögen, müssen)

We can think of these verbs as changing the way we think of the verb (as an infinitive or past participle) they are paired with.

When haben and sein are used with a past participle, they indicate that the action of the other verb has already happened:

- ich sehe (I see)
- ich habe gesehen (I have [already!] seen = I saw)
- ich hatte gesehen (I had [already!] seen)

Werden as a verb means "to become" and thus indicates something that has *not yet happened*. When used as a helping verb with an infinitive, it indicates that the other verb has not (yet) happened:

- ich gehe (I go)
- ich werde gehen (I will go [but haven't yet])
- ich würde gehen (I would go [but haven't yet, and probably won't]

Werden is also used to make the passive voice: a present or past form of werden is combined with the past participle of a transitive verb (one that can take a direct object):

- der Apfel wird gegessen (the apple is eaten)
- der Apfel wurde gegessen (the apple was eaten)
- der Apfel ist gegessen worden (the apple was eaten)

The modal verbs by themselves indicate ability, desire, and obligation, and when combined with an infinitive they indicate one's desire, obligation or ability regarding the other verb:

- ich spreche (I speak [an action taken])
- ich kann sprechen (I can speak [indicates ability])
- ich wollte sprechen (I wanted to speak [indicates a desire to have done something in the past])
- ich möchte sprechen (I would like to speak [indicates a desire to do something])
- ich musste sprechen (I had to speak [indicates a past obligation])
