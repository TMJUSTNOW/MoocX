# Spanish Classes
[BCBL](http://www.bcbl.eu/) has recently started a new Spanish language course, it's being taught by [el aula azul](http://www.elaulaazul.com/home-2/?idioma=en) and I am one of the students :). So, I am going to convert all my notes into `pdf` and keep updating this repository as I go through the course. Let's see how it turns out.
