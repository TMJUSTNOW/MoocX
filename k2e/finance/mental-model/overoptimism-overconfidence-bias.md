Definition

This isour natural tendency to be over-optimistic and how that affects our decisions.Take a common example you may have heard a number of times. The ancient Greekorator Demosthenes famously said three centuries before Christ, 'What a manwishes, that also will he believe.'

Modern risk management

 

  Would you like to jump out of this planewith this parachute which opens 99% of the time? Modern Risk ManagementPractices Advocate that you should jump. Modern risk management practices (e.g.VAR) assume that we live in aworld best described by a bell curve whereoutliers are extremely rare, and that resulted in management practices thatwere far more risky than was previously imagined. 

 

VAR: Astatistical tool that roughly says most of the you won’t lose more than x in aday or year. But its’ silent on what happens rest of the time. Also, itsﬁndings are based on history.

 

Even in 1965, perhaps we could have judged there to be a 99%probability that higher leverage would lead to nothing but good. - Buffet

Buffett in 1989 letter - “We wouldn't have liked those 99:1 odds -and never will. A small chance of distress or disgrace cannot, in our view, beoffset by a large chance of extra returns.”

Roleof derivatives: ﬁnancialinstruments of mass destruction.examples: Wockhardt, textile companies in SouthIndia, hedge fund blow ups, banks blowup.

 Thatis key. There are certain decisions you make in life that are irreversible,that lead you into a path you cant get out of, and unless you have more thanone escape clause, the adversary can gang up on you and destroy you.What else?I didn't have a proper foundation. I was not sufficiently private in myactivities. I was playing poker with men named Doc. I must've made a hundrederrors on that one, but those are ﬁve or six that come to mind. - Niederhoffer

Wait Until You Shake Your Head. 

It’s easyto lend money and fool yourself into believing that you’ll make a good rate ofreturn. It reminds me of a story about two men in a sword ﬁght. One of themtakes a big swipe on the other one’s neck whereupon the other one says “Youmissed me.”

England and France Tunnel Project 

TheCompany was formed on 13 August 1986 with the objective of ﬁnancing, building and operating a tunnelbetween England and France. The Company let a contract for the construction ofthe tunnel to TransManche Link. The tunnel cost around £9.5bn to build, aboutdouble its original estimate of £4.7bn. The tunnel, which was ﬁnanced partlyfrom investment by shareholders and partly from £8bn of debt, was officiallyopened on 6 May 19In its ﬁrst year of operation the Company lost £925m becauseof disappointing revenues from passengers and freight together with heavy interestcharges on its £8bn of debt.

 

The noida toll bridge

Look whatoverconfidence does.Look for leverage if you want to look foroverconfidence.The interest on the debt was more than the gross revenues!Howcan you ﬁnance a project with debt where you have to make money from largelyunpredictable consumer behavior? This was the ﬁrst toll bridge...RememberFeynman who remarked how difficult physics would have been if particles hadfeelings?

 

Recallthat this is a “man on a roll” we found in a previous class. Hw just won a lotof money in the casino. What will do next? Walk out with his winnings? Hell no!He will go back to the table and play more thinking “This is the just thebeginning of my streak.” His behavior will ultimately ruin him.Last time whenwe talked of him, he was high on dopamine. Dopamine produced over-conﬁdence.

1. Request subjects     to evaluate their conﬁdence in a statement. Group together all the     statements with a given level of conﬁdence (e.g., 90%) and compare that to     the actual frequency of being correct.
2. Test subjects with     multiple-choice questions and then elicit their level of conﬁdence in     their answer on a scale from chance to 100% (total certainty). Compare     this to the true accuracy of the answers.
3. Give subjects a question with     a numerical answer, and get them to choose a conﬁdence interval such that     they have a particular level of conﬁdence that the true answer is in that     range; e.g., "Pick a low number and a high number such that you are     90% conﬁdent that the population of Bulgaria is between those     numbers." - we did this a while ago.
4. Offer subjects the     opportunity to bet on the correctness of their answers with chances that     are favorable, if their judgements of accuracy are correct. They lose     money if they are overconfident. If you are 90% sure, then you should be     comfortable betting 9againstprospectofwillingjust9againstprospectofwillingjust1 that the real is     within your chosen range.

Ifhuman conﬁdence had perfectcalibration, judgements with 100% conﬁdence would be correct 100% of the time,90% conﬁdence correct 90% of the time, and so on for the other levels ofconﬁdence.  By contrast, the key ﬁnding is that conﬁdence exceeds accuracyso long as thesubject is answering hard questions about an unfamiliar topic. Ina spelling task, subjects were correct about 80% of the time when theywere"100% certain".

 

Putanother way, the error rate was 20% when subjects expected it to be 0%.

Is Justin Timberlake a product of CumulativeAdvantage? 

This isone of best controlled experiments in social science I have readabout..http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/magazine/15wwlnidealab.t.htmlWeb-basedexperiment. More than 14,000 participants registered at MusicLab(www.musiclab.columbia.edu), and were asked to listen to, rate and, if theychose, download songs bybands they had never heard of. Some of the participantssaw only the names of the songs and bands,while others also saw how many timesthe songs had been downloaded by previous participants. Thissecond group —“social inﬂuence” condition — was further split into eight parallel “worlds”such thatparticipants could see the prior downloads of people only in their ownworld. All the artists in all theworlds started out identically, with zero downloads— but because the different worlds were keptseparate, they subsequently evolvedindependently of one another.You should see the parallels with Darwin’s Theoryof Evolution as you read about this story.

Inall the social-inﬂuence worlds,the most popular songs were much more popular (and the least popular songs werelesspopular) than in the independent condition.At the same time, however, theparticular songs that became hits were different in different worlds, just ascumulative-advantage theory would predict. Introducing social inﬂuence intohuman decision making, in other words, didn’t just makethe hits bigger; it alsomade them more unpredictable.When people tend to like what other people like,differences in popularity are subject to what is called “cumulativeadvantage,”or the “rich get richer” effect. This means that if one object happens to beslightly more popular than another atjust the right point, it will tend tobecome more popular stil.As a result, even tiny, random ﬂuctuations can blowup, generating potentially enormous long-run differences amongevenindistinguishable competitors...Thus, if history were to be somehow rerunmany times, seemingly identical universes with the same set of competitorsandthe same overall market tastes would quickly generate different winners:Madonna would have been popular in this world,but in some other version ofhistory, she would be a nobody, and someone we have never heard of would be inher place.

Excelcan make you go nuts.The deﬁnitionof value is very precise. There is no ambiguity about it. All one has to do isto take thefuture cash ﬂows and then bring them back to the present value usingdiscount factor which is theopportunity cost of capital derived from a veryprecise model called the Capital Asset Pricing Model. Youpunch in the numbersin that model and out comes the cost of capital and then you punch thatnumberin another excel model containing future cash ﬂows and the preciseformulas in that excel model will tellyou instantly what that business isworth.The sheer number of assumptions in a valuation model are mind boggling

Extrapolation,ignorance of diseconomies of scale, ignorance of competition, regulation.Minorchanges in inputs can make a vast difference in the ﬁnal valuation numberInsome cases, most of the value is comprised in cash ﬂows which will occurseveral years from now. So wehave to worry about forecast degradation.Increasing the discount factor is not the way to do it!Underneath all thatprecision of that “precise model” is the defective man with all his biases.What biases creepinto the excel valuation models?

“It’sstupid the waypeople extrapolate the past- and notslightly stupid, butmassively stupid.”

“I don’tthink you can stick numbers on a highly speculative business where the wholeindustry is going to change in 5 years and have it mean anything.”“If you say,“I am going to stick an extra 6% on the interest rate to allow forthat” I thinkthat’s nonsense. It may look mathematical, but itsmathematical gibberish in myview. . .”Buffett does not think about cost of capital the way academic ﬁnancethinksabout the subject.

“thetest used by most CEOs – isthat the cost of capital is about ¼ of 1% below the return promised by any dealthat the CEO wants to do!”Thats why Excel Models can be used to rationalizealmost any desiredbehavior!

“Anybusiness craving of the leader, however foolish, will be quickly supported bydetailed rate- of-return and strategic studies prepared by his troops.”Man isnot a rational animal; rather man is a rationalizing one…And Excel is abeautiful tool which helps him do just that!You don’t even need “Goal Seek”function because its already built into thehuman user!

Thereis extreme wisdom in the idea that diversiﬁcation is protection against ignorance andif you are not ignorantthen your need to diversify goes down. Mr. Munger put it in thesewords:“It isnot given to human beings to have such talent that they can just knoweverything abouteverything all the time. But it is given to human beings whowork hard at it – who look andsift the world for a mispriced bet – that theycan occasionally ﬁnd one. And the wise ones betheavily when the world offersthem that opportunity. They bet big when they have odds. Andthe rest of thetime, they dont. Its just that simple.”But what if you over-estimate your oddsof success - a tendency that is pervasive?

Of courseif people were rational, there wont be so many startups.“If people were notoverconﬁdent, for example, signiﬁcantly fewer people would ever start anewbusiness: most entrepreneurs know the odds of success are against them, yetthey try anyway. Thattheir optimism is misplaced—that they are overconﬁdent—isevidenced by the fact that more than two-thirds of small businesses fail withinfour years of inception. Put another way, most small-businessowners believethat they have what it takes to overcome the obstacles to success, but most ofthem arewrong.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_spirits_(Keynes)

“animalspirits - a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as theoutcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied byquantitative probabilities.”- Keynes"Even apart from the instability dueto speculation, there is the instability due to the characteristic ofhumannature that a large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneousoptimism ratherthan mathematical expectations, whether moral or hedonistic oreconomic. Most, probably, of ourdecisions to do something positive, the fullconsequences of which will be drawn out over many days tocome, can only betaken as the result of animal spirits - a spontaneous urge to action ratherthaninaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitativebeneﬁts multiplied byquantitativeprobabilities."http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_spirits_(Keynes)

The mainbenefit of optimism is resilience in the face of setbacks.Optimistic bias playsa role—sometimes the dominant role—whenever individuals orinstitutionsvoluntarily take on signiﬁcant risks. More often than not, risktakersunderestimate the odds they face, and do invest sufficient effort to ﬁndout what the oddsare. Because they misread the risks, optimistic entrepreneursoften believe they are prudent,even when they are not. Their conﬁdence in theirfuture success sustains a positive moodthat helps them obtain resources fromothers, raise the morale of their employees, andenhance their prospects ofprevailing. When action is needed, optimism, even of the mildlydelusionalvariety, may be a good thing. - Kahneman

OptimismBias“Optimistic bias is a signiﬁcant source of risk taking. In the standard rational model ofeconomics,people take risks because the odds are favorable—they accept someprobability of a costly failurebecause the probability of success issufficient. We proposed an alternative idea. When forecasting theoutcomes ofrisky projects, executives too easily fall victim to the planning fallacy. Inits grip, they makedecisions based on delusional optimism rather than on arational weighting of gains, losses, andprobabilities. They overestimatebeneﬁts and underestimate costs. They spin scenarios of successwhileoverlooking the potential for mistakes and miscalculations. As a result,they pursue initiatives that areunlikely to come in on budget or on time or todeliver the expected returns—or even to be completed. Inthis view, people often(but not always) take on risky projects because they are overly optimisticaboutthe odds they face.This idea probably contributes to an explanation of whypeople litigate, why they start wars, and whythey open small businesses.” -Kahneman

OptimismBias“Optimism is normal, but some fortunate people are more optimistic than therest of us. If you are genetically endowed with an optimisticbias, you hardlyneed to be told that you are a lucky person—you already feel fortunate. Anoptimistic attitude is largely inherited, and it ispart of a generaldisposition for well-being, which may also include a preference for seeing thebright side of everything. If you wereallowed one wish for your child,seriously consider wishing him or her optimism. Optimists are normally cheerfuland happy, and thereforepopular; they are resilient in adapting to failures andhardships, their chances of clinical depression are reduced, their immunesystem isstronger, they take better care of their health, they feel healthierthan others and are in fact likely to live longer. A study of peoplewhoexaggerate their expected life span beyond actuarial predictions showed thatthey work longer hours, are more optimistic about theirfuture income, are morelikely to remarry after divorce (the classic “triumph of hope overexperience”), and are more prone to bet onindividual stocks. Of course, theblessings of optimism are offered only to individuals who are only mildlybiased and who are able to“accentuate the positive” without losing track ofreality. Optimistic individuals play a disproportionate role in shaping ourlives. Theirdecisions make a difference; they are the inventors, theentrepreneurs, the political and military leaders—not average people. They gottowhere they are by seeking challenges and taking risks. They are talented andthey have been lucky, almost certainly luckier than theyacknowledge.” -Kahneman

Theprevalent tendency to underweight or ignore distributional information isperhaps the major source of error in forecasting. -Bent Flyvbjerg.PlanningFallacy: Plans and forecasts that1. are unrealistically close to best-casescenarios2. could be improved by consulting the statistics of similarcasesUsing the “inside view” and not the “outside view”“Pallid” statisticalinformation is routinely discarded when it is incompatible with one’s personalimpressions ofa case. In the competition with the inside view, the outside viewdoesn’t stand a chance. The preference for theinside view sometimes carriesmoral overtones. I once asked my cousin, a distinguished lawyer, aquestionabout a reference class: “What is the probability of the defendantwinning in cases like this one?” His sharpanswer that “every case is unique”was accompanied by a look that made it clear he found my questioninappropriateand superﬁcial.Insensitivity to base rates

Identifyan appropriate reference class. Obtain the statistics of the reference classUse the statistics to generate a baseline prediction. Use specific informationabout the case to adjust the baseline prediction, if there are particularreasons to expect the optimistic bias to be more or less pronounced in thisproject than in others of the same type.How to overcome planning fallacy.Butwhat about Bugsy?

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Bugsy_SiegelBugsy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Bugsy_SiegelBugsy)trailer.

Snapshotof movie’s endBugsy last SceneHe was over-leveraged, over-conﬁdent, anddead.Watch this movie. Its about a man you would think as totally crazy. Buthecreated Las Vegas. People thought he was crazy. And he was. The world needsalot of people Bugsy. They drive capitalism. Warren Buffett would neverdoanything as crazy as a Bugsy because Warren Buffett is RATIONAL.So what doyou want to be like? Rational like Warren Buffett or crazy like WarrenBeatty(who plays the role of Bugsy in the movie)?

WhyWe need Bugsy“Signiﬁcant effortis required to ﬁnd the relevantreference category, estimate the baseline prediction, and evaluate the qualityofthe evidence. The effort is justiﬁed only when the stakes are high and whenyou are particularly keen not to make mistakes.Furthermore, you should knowthat correcting your intuitions may complicate your life. A characteristic ofunbiased predictionsis that they permit the prediction of rare or extremeevents only when the information is very good. If you expect yourpredictions tobe of modest validity, you will never guess an outcome that is either rare orfar from the mean. If your predictionsare unbiased, you will never have thesatisfying experience of correctly calling an extreme case. You will never beable to say, “Ithought so!” when your best student in law school becomes aSupreme Court justice, or when a start-up that you thought verypromisingeventually becomes a major commercial success. Given the limitations of theevidence, you will never predict that anoutstanding high school student will bea straight-A student at Princeton. For the same reason, a venture capitalistwill never betold that the probability of success for a start-up in its earlystages is “very high.” The objections to the principle of moderatingintuitivepredictions must be taken seriously, because absence of bias is not always whatmatters most. A preference forunbiased predictions is justiﬁed if all errors ofprediction are treated alike, regardless of their direction. But there aresituationsin which one type of error is much worse than another. When a venturecapitalist looks for “the next big thing,” the risk ofmissing the next Googleor Facebook is far more important than the risk of making a modest investmentin a start-up thatultimately fails. The goal of venture capitalists is to callthe extreme cases correctly, even at the cost of overestimating theprospects ofmany other ventures.” - Kahneman

Where do we see Optimism Bias?

Oftenfound in: Our views about things that affect us

In Life 

In Life:It is not necessary for us to suffer or be in pain for the overoptimismtendency to come into action. As humans, we often display an excess ofself-optimism even where there is no pain or threat of pain. As such, excessiveself-optimism tendency becomes a normal human condition that can lead us tobelieving a number things that may not be correct. Munger gives the example of'happy people buying lottery tickets or believing that credit-furnishing,delivery-making grocery stores were going to displace a great manysuperefficient cash-and-carry supermarkets.'

In corporations 

Incorporations: Even companies can get carried away with the overoptimism bug.Tulsi Tanti of Suzlon went on a global shopping spree apparently overoptimisticabout the wonders that wind power could do for him. Tata acquired Corus justbefore the financial crisis hit and was saddled with debt. Havells acquiredSylvania - a company much bigger than itself - and nearly went down under.

In investing 

Ininvesting: How many of us have been largely over-optimistic for quite some timenow about acche din aayengey, even when there is no conclusive data till dateof things turning around for core sectors? The overoptimism bug in investingcan cause much harm if you continue to remain over-optimistic about a company,trend or market direction.

 

Overcoming Overoptimism Bias

What isthe antidote to the overoptmism tendency? Here is Munger's prescription, 'Onestandard antidote to foolish optimism is trained, habitual use of the simpleprobability math of Fermat and Pascal, taught in my youth to high schoolsophomores.'
