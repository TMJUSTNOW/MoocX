Peopleoriginally discovered physics and other sciences by asking how and [why](https://janav.wordpress.com/2013/06/09/why/) questions. Recently I read the book [How Everything Works](http://www.amazon.com/How-Everything-Works-Physics-Ordinary/dp/0470170662) by LouisA. Bloomfield. This book teaches physics by answering the how and why questionson everyday objects that we see and use. In this post I will be explainingabout Newton’s three laws of motion.

First Law

Newtonsfirst law of motion is about inertia. Let us understand inertia intuitively from Richard Feynman. In thebook [The Pleasure of Finding Things Out](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pleasure-Finding-Things-Out/dp/0465023959) hewrites

One day when I was playing with what we call an express wagon, whichis a little wagon which has a railing around it for children to play with thatthey can pull around. It had a ball in it – I remember this – it had a ball init, and I pulled the wagon and I noticed something about the way the ballmoved, so I went to my father and I said, “Say, Pop, I noticed something: WhenI pull the wagon the ball rolls to the back of the wagon, and when I’m pullingit along and I suddenly stop, the ball rolls to the front of the wagon,” and Isays, “why is that?” And he said, “That nobody knows,” he said. “The general principle is that things thatare moving try to keep on moving and things that are standing still tend tostand still unless you push on them hard.” And he says,“This tendency is called inertia but nobody knows why it’s true.” Now that’s a deep understanding –he doesn’t give me a name, he knows the difference between knowing the name ofsomething and knowing something. which I learnt very early.

Theline above that is marked in bold is newtons first law. Watch the video, whichis taken from the movie Infinity in which Feynman’s father explains inertia toFeynman.

Nowits time to look at the official definition of first law: An object that is not subject to anyoutside forces moves at a constant velocity, covering equal distances in equaltimes along a straight line path. In order tounderstand this definition you need to understand five important physicalquantities relating to motion and look at their relationships to one another.The physical quantities are (1) position (2) velocity (3) acceleration (4) mass (5) force. I am going to use the imagegiven below to explain these physical quantities

[![velocity](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/6F592FB1-ACC7-2E43-A658-E3466C4F2879.png)](https://janav.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/velocity.jpg)

Position: It is a vector quantity. Avector has both magnitude and direction. The first picture of the boy is hisposition. At t=0 seconds the boy is standing 1m away from the tree in the eastdirection. A position has a magnitude, direction, and a reference point. Inthis case the reference point is a tree.

Velocity: At t=1 second the boy moves from1m to 2m. He changed position. Velocity measures how quickly your positionchanges. It is a vector quantity and consists of the speed at which you aremoving and the direction in which you are heading. In this case the boy ismoving at a velocity of 1 m/s in the east direction.

Acceleration: Att=2 seconds the boy moves from 2m to 4m. He changes velocity from 1 m/s to 2m/s. This change in velocity is called as acceleration and it is also a vectorquantity. In this case the boy is accelerating at 1 m/s2 in theeast direction. If the velocity does not change then its acceleration is zeroand the object is undergoing a constant velocity.

Mass: It is a measure of inertia and itresists changes in velocity. Almost every object in the universe has mass. Att=2 seconds the boy changes velocity from 1 m/s to 2 m/s. For this to happenthe boy has to experience an external force to overcome his mass. The standardunit of mass is kilogram.

Force: It is apush or pull on an object causing it to change its velocity i.e. to accelerate.It is also a vector quantity. The standard unit of force is newton. Anewton is equal to the force that would give a mass of one kilogram anacceleration of one meter per second2.

Letme given an analogy to explain mass and force. I want to exercise every day.But I do not. Whatever prevents me from exercising is the mass. After readingthis [article](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/03/brain-rules-12-things-we-know-about-how-the-brain-works/) I came to knowthat exercise boosts brain power. After that I startedexercising regularly. This article is the force which made me to overcomemy mass. Mass in physics is similar to [status quo](https://janav.wordpress.com/2013/03/28/status-quo-bias/) bias in psychology. Force inphysics is similar to [incentives](https://janav.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/incentives/) in psychology. Now reread the official definition of newtonsfirst law and you should be able to understand it easily. Many commonactivities depends on inertia. For example food processors, blenders, andcoffee grinders can dice or puree foods that are held in place by their owninertia.

Second Law

If Iapply the same unit of force to a tennis ball and a bowling ball which one willaccelerate faster? Your intuition should tell that that the tennis ball willaccelerate faster. Why? The reason is because the mass of a tennis ball islesser than the mass of a bowling ball. From this logic we can come up with thefollowing formula.

acceleration = force / mass

Forthe same unit of force, larger mass results in smaller acceleration and smallermass results in larger acceleration. This is newtons second law. Theofficial definition is: Theforce exerted on an object is equal to the product of that object’s mass timesits acceleration. The acceleration is in the same direction as the force. This is given by the formula shown below. Both the formulasare the same. The former is cleaner as it separates cause (force and mass) andeffect (acceleration) cleanly. But the latter is used often in the textbooks.

force = mass * acceleration

Nowtry to answer the following question: If I drop a bowling ball and a tennisball at the same time from the Empire state building which ball will hit theground first? We will assume that there is negligible air resistance. Aristotlea famous greek philosopher told that the heavier object will hit the groundfaster than the lighter object. If we take Aristotle words then the bowlingball will hit the ground first. People believed this for 2000 years. But thisis not true. Why nobody cared to verify Aristotle statement? It is because of [AuthorityBias](https://janav.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/authority/) and [SocialProof](https://janav.wordpress.com/2013/05/12/social-proof/). In the year 1589 an Italian physicistnamed Galileo proved that both the balls will hit the ground at the sametime.

Letus find out why this is the case. In order to answer this question we need tounderstand what gravity is. Gravity is a downward force which Earth exerts onany object near its surface. That object is attracted directly toward thecenter of the earth with a force called as weight. Earth exerts 1 newtondownward force on a mass of 102 grams. Hence for 1 kilogram of mass earthwill exert 9.8 newton force (1000 grams / 102 grams). From this we can derivethe relationship between mass and weight. Remember that mass isa fundamental measure of the amount of matter in the object. Mass of anobject will be the same anywhere in the universe. The standard unit of mass isKilogram. The weight of an object is the force of gravity on the object.Depending on which planet the object is in its weight will vary. Thestandard unit of weight is newton.

weight = mass * acceleration due togravity

weight = mass * 9.8 m/s2

[![mass_and_weight](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/D338C7BC-1121-2A49-B6BD-DCA6A1F98C72.png)](https://janav.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/mass_and_weight.gif)

Now wehave all the information we need to answer why both the ball’s will hit theground at the same time. As you can see that weight and mass are proportionalto each other by a factor of acceleration due to gravity. Hence for everyobject weight and mass cancel leaving acceleration due to gravity which is aconstant. Hence all the objects hit the ground at the same time. We resolved2000+ years of misunderstanding.

Acceleration =
Force / Ball Mass [Newton 2nd
law]
We know that the only force acting on a falling object is the Ball's Weight.

Acceleration =
Ball Weight / Ball Mass
Acceleration = (Ball Mass * acceleration due to gravity) / Ball
Mass
Acceleration = 9.8 m/s2

Third Law

Imaginea piano resting on a sidewalk outside your house. According to newtons secondlaw, earth should be pulling the piano with a downward force which should causethe piano to fall down. But the piano is standing still on the sidewalk. Didthe gravity disappear? No the gravity is still there. You can verify that byputting your foot underneath the piano. The pain resulting from that will tellyou that gravity is still there. Newtons third law will answer why the piano isnot falling down. The third law is: For every force that one object exerts on a second object, there isan equal but oppositely directed force that the second object exerts on thefirst object. The weight of the piano is balanced by anequal but oppositely directed force from the sidewalk. Hence the piano does notfall down.

Newtonsthird law is misunderstood by a lot of people. When you push on an object theobject pushes back on you. Since these are equal and opposite forces theycancel out each other perfectly and hence there will be no effect on you or theobject. Is this understanding correct? No. Given below is the explanation fromthe book [How Everything Works](http://www.amazon.com/How-Everything-Works-Physics-Ordinary/dp/0470170662)

The two forces described by Newton’s third law always act on twodifferent things. Your push acts on the object while the object’s push acts onyou. Since the object accelerates in response to the net force it experiences –the sum of all individual forces acting on it – it is affected only by yourforce on it, not by its force on you. If you are the only thing pushing on it,it will accelerate. And if the object is the only thing pushing on you, you’llaccelerate, too!

Watchthe video which clearly explains our misunderstanding of newtons third law.
