Definition

Old isnot always wise. Senescence refers to biological ageing. This is the naturaltendency of the human body to lose cognitive abilities with age, but this isaddressable by continuous learning. Says Munger, 'With advanced age, therecomes a natural cognitive decay, differing among individuals in the earlinessof its arrival and the speed of its progression. Practically no one is good atlearning complex new skills when very old. But some people remain pretty goodin maintaining intensely practiced old skills until late in life as one cannotice in many a bridge tournament.' 

Oftenfound in: Age progression

Somepeople can hide their senescence-related deterioration very well. ExplainsMunger, 'Old people like me get pretty skilled, without working at it, atdisguising age-related deterioration because social convention, like clothing,hides much decline.'

Toprevent the senescence-misinfluence tendency, don't wait to grow old and thenface the problem. Everyone can benefit from learning new skills at any age.That's Munger's prescription to prevent this tendency from taking its hold overyou. 'Continuous thinking and learning, done with joy, can somewhat help delaywhat is inevitable.'
