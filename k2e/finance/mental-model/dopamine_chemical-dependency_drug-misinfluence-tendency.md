Dopamineby Prof Sanjay Bakshi OR Chemical Dependency by Munger. He also usesDrug-Misinfluence (not sure about it)

Definition

This isthe power that drugs and alcohol hold over your cognitive abilities and howthey impair judgement. It is frequently seen that individuals commit crimesunder the influence of drugs. The drug-misinfluence tendency is powerful enoughto devastate lives and careers of the persons involved.

Oftenfound in: Instances of addiction to either drugs or alcohol, which impairsjudgement.

Thedrug-misinfluence tendency is often found working with the simple,pain-avoiding psychological denial tendency. Here's how it works: 'We've allseen so much [drug abuse], but it's interesting how it'll always cause thismoral breakdown if there's any need, and it always involves massive denial.'

Examples

Dot com craze 

[frontline:dot con | PBS](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/dotcon/)

 

The sceneshows how Americans went crazy over dotcoms. It also shows how ecstaticemployees of E-Loan felt when their stock options in the company which had justgone public became so valuable that some of them became millionaires.

These areE-Loan employees. The company just listed. It has NO business. It’s office isEMPTY.The market value of the company is $2 billion.

Noticethey just had an unexpected pleasant surprise.

 

We areVERY INTERESTED in studying such people. What happens to them? What is their“state of mind?”

 

They areso happy, and so foolish (we know this of course with the beneﬁt of hindsightas almost all dotcoms fell by more than 90% post listing).

 

Peoplewere equally ecstatic during Tulipomania, The South Sea Bubble.

 

Financial Euphoria

People are Most Credulous when they are most happy - Walter Bagehot.

WalterBagehot was right. When people are happy, they will believe almost anything.They become extremely suggestible.

 

We wantto know what’s happening inside the brains of very happy people who just madean unexpected killing in the stock market, or won a lottery,or won in thecasino...

“This is a world inhabited not by people who have to be persuaded tobelieve but by people who want an excuse to believe.”- John Kenneth Galbraith

 Peoplewant to latch on to just about any reason to do what they have already decidedto do…

Galbraithwas right.

 

Youshould read two of his books - The Great Crash 1929, and A Short History ofFinancial Euphoria.

 

“FinancialEuphoria”. Nice term. Is it similar to other kinds of euphorias? What otherdomains exist in which humans experience euphoria?

There isno difference between a man who just made a killing in the markets and a manwho is high on cocaine.

 

Doctorscannot tell the difference from fMRI scans between the two.So we now know thatdoing drugs and making a killing in the markets are virtually identical.

If labrats are wired up to receive tiny pulses of electrical stimulation in thedopamine centers of the brain when they press a lever, they often begin tappingit nonstop to the exclusion of other activities, including eating and drinking.

 

Theywould rather starve to death than live without that dopamine surge inside theirbrains.

 

The humanequivalent of this Lab Rat is there in all of us…After all, don’t we keep onclicking on link after link on the internet, using the mice of our comps justto get a novelty-induced kick? Internet addiction is like all other addictions…

 

What arethe consequences of internet addiction?

 

“The thrill of the chase blinded the pursuers to the consequences ofthe catch.” - Buffett

Addictedgamblers chain themselves to slot machines.

“Chains of habit are too light to be felt, until they are too heavyto be broken” - Buffett

Studyingthe business of gambling and gambling addiction is a great way to learn abouthuman nature.

 

What Ireally love is how it gets rationalized…

 

If youwork for a gambling casino as an employee, how would you respond to the ideathat gambling is bad for civilization?

 

Are theirfunctional equivalents of gambling casinos? How about day-trading? Orspeculating in derivatives?

Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money. -Buffett

 Ilove this quote. He knows what it must be like to make a lot of money.

 

Whathappens to a gambler who through sheer randomness wins the jackpot? What is hegoing to think? Was it luck? Of course not. He is going to think “his systemworks.” And then he is going to think “this is just the beginning, and I am ona roll, I can see the future, nothing can stop me - I am the master of theuniverse.”

 

Forhim, this one time-lucky gain would look like the initial cash ﬂow from a growing perpetuity he justcreated with his “effort.” He will start having “delusions of grandeur,” hewill start thinking, “why do I have to even go to my clinic to see my patientsand earn only so much, I can do much better by just using my system to getrich.”

 

What’sgoing on in the head of this man? Well, his head is practically drowning in arush of dopamine…

 

Generalprinciple: When your dopamine levels are high, you risk becoming over-conﬁdent and foolish.

 

This is aman in a “HOT STATE”. So were the people who worked for E-Loan at the time theylearnt they were paper millionaires. So were the people who thought they hadbecome rich permanently because they owned a very rare and very precious tulipbulb.

 

Are thereany other “HOT STATES?” Yes there are...

 

Unexpectedpleasant surprises make people ecstatic because of the dopamine surge theyproduce.

 

Gettingwhat you expected produces no dopamine kick.

 

However,an unexpected gain ﬁres up thebrain (neurons go from ﬁring 3times a second to 40times a second).

 

Ifexpected reward fails to materialize, dopamine dries up. If you want to makeyour girl/boy friend really happy, give her/him an expected pleasantsurprise-but don’t make a habit of it for then it will cease to be a surprise.

 

Dopaminesystem loves novel stimuli. Variety is the spice dope of [market] life.

 

Vividstock market screens and real time charts offer frequent change (i.e.volatility) and sometimes unexpected good surprises, thereby producing surgesof dopamine which results in addiction.

 

Daytraders, like cocaine addicts, are in it more for the dopamine than for themoney.

 

Internetaddiction - our lowing attention spans, caused due to distractions...

 

We loveobserving fast action because its EXCITING!

“Severe change and exceptional returns usually don't mix. - Buffett

“Mostinvestors, of course, behave as if just the opposite were true. That is,theyusually confer the highest price-earnings ratios on exotic-sounding businessesthat hold out the promise of feverish change…”

 

“Thatprospect lets investors fantasize [THINK DOPAMINE] about future proﬁtabilityrather than face today's business realities. For such investor-dreamers, anyblind date is preferable to one with the girl next door, no matter howdesirable she may be.”

 

IPOs, NewHot Stocks e.g. dotcoms, Fashion industry, Movie business, Music business,Airline industry.

 

Averageperson buys more aggressively in response to recent price rises - expectationof further rises

 

“We make bricks in Texas which use the same process as inMesopotamia.” - Munger

WarrenBuffett has made most of his money in businesses which you may consider asBORING - Carpets, furniture, insurance, candy, cola…People who invest in“exciting” businesses - are they doing it for the money or the dope?
