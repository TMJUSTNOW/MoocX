In[probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), base rate generallyrefers to the (base) class probabilities unconditioned on featural evidence,frequently also known as [priorprobabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probabilities). For example, if it were the casethat 1% of the public were "medical professionals", and 99% of thepublic were not "medical professionals", then the base rate of medicalprofessionals is simply 1%.
