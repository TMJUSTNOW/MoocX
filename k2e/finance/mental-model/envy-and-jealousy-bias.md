Envy OR ईर्ष्याis one of the [seven deadly sins](http://deadlysins.com/sins/index.htm). It is very self-explanatory, but lets discuss it.

 

Ofthe seven deadly sins – Pride,Gluttony, Lust, Anger, Greed, Sloth, and Envy – there is only onesin which has no upsideassociated with it. Which one? Pride? No. Anexcessively proud person does get some kick out of his behaviour. Same withgluttony. A glutton may become sick after his gluttonous behaviour, but at themoment of eating, he is really liking it. Lust? Of course not – no explanationsneeded here! Anger? No again. Everyone knows how nice it feels occasionally tovent one’s anger. Greed? No again, as Gekko put it “greed is good” and often itis. Sloth? Nyet – every couch potato knows and experiences the upside of sloth.So, using backward thinking ;)we’re left with the last sin on the list – the deadliest of the seven deadlysins – ENVY.

  

Envyis the only sin out of the seven deadly sins that gives no upside at all – nokick at all – to its practitioner. The envious people in the world aremiserable people because there is only downside risk, and no upside reward inbeing envious. Looked from an investor’s viewpoint, the lesson is simple: ifyou want to conquer the seven deadly sins, the first one to conquer is envy.And, maybe, the only one to conquer is envy. ;)

 

Self-explanatory,but Munger makes an interesting point that envy/jealously tendency issurprisingly absent from most Psychology textbooks.

Mungersays:

“How crazy it would be to be made miserable by the fact that someoneelse is doing better because someone else is always going to be doing better atany human activity you can name.” 

 “What the hell do I care if somebody else makes money faster.There’s always going to be somebody who is making money faster, running themile faster or what have you. Once you get something that works ﬁne in yourlife, the idea of caring terribly that somebody else is making money fasterstrikes me as insane.” 

“If you’ve got a way of investing your money that is overwhelminglylikely to keep you comfortably rich and someone else ﬁnds something that wouldmake him richer faster, that is not a big tragedy.

Envyand jealousy are a part of our evolutionary make-up, says Munger. 'A member ofa species designed through evolutionary process to want often-scarce foodis going to be driven strongly toward getting food when it first sees food. Andthis is going to occur often and tend to create some conflict when the food isseen in the possession of another member of the same species. This is probablythe evolutionary origin of the envy/jealousy tendency that lies so deep in thehuman nature.'

The vicesof jealously have been warned about in the scriptures of every religion.'Envy/jealousy is extreme in myth, religion, and literature, wherein, inaccount after account, it triggers hatred and injury. It was regarded as sopernicious by the Jews of the civilization that preceded Christ that it wasforbidden, by phrase after phrase, in the laws of Moses. You were even warnedby the Prophet not to covet your neighbor's donkey,' says Munger.

Impact of Envy

In Life 

In Life:How about one of the most common example of a friend or a colleague or thatsnob relative who is making more money than you and flashing it all around.Munger has some words of advice, 'The idea of caring that someone is makingmoney faster [than you are] is one of the deadly sins. Envy is a really stupidsin because it's the only one you could never possibly have any fun at. There'sa lot of pain and no fun. Why would you want to get on that trolley?'

Wantmore? 'Well envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those ofyou who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm orinvestment bank or even a faculty? I've heard Warren say a half a dozen times,'It's not greed that drives the world, but envy.'

Incorporations 'Many big law firms, fearing disorder from envy/jealousy, havelong treated all senior partners alike in compensation, no matter how differenttheir contributions to firm welfare.'

In Investing 

InInvesting: How about some wisdom from Munger? Munger says, 'Missing out on someopportunity never bothers us. What's wrong with someone getting a little richerthan you? It's crazy to worry about this.'

'Here'sone truth that perhaps your typical investment counselor would disagree with:if you're comfortably rich and someone else is getting richer faster than youby, for example, investing in risky stocks, so what?! Someone will always begetting richer faster than you. This is not a tragedy.' It's as simple as this.
