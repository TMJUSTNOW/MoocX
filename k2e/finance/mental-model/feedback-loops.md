Fewweeks back, Vishal was conducting the Art of Investing workshop in Bangalore andhe asked me to speak on the subject of human behaviour and how it relates toinvesting.

Now,unlike him, I am not used to speaking in front of a large audience. Although itwas a room full of around 50 people, but for me anything more than two is acrowd. So to say that I had butterflies in my stomach would be anunderstatement. It felt like flying horses in my belly.

Finallywhen Vishal handed over the mic to me, one part of my brain was trying hard tocontrol my shaking legs, the other part was busy adjusting (with tremblinghands) the microphone attached to my shirt.

Just whenthe first word came out from my mouth, a loud screeching noise echoed in theroom. For a moment I thought that my heart, which by that time was poundinghard against my chest, had come out. Then I realized that the loud noise wascoming from the speakers. I immediately cut it by covering the mic with myhand.

It’s apretty common problem (sound from the speakers feeding back into themicrophone, and then going in an unending loop between speaker and mic, oftencausing a loud squeal) and most of you must be familiar with this kind of audiofeedback noise. This acoustic problem can be easily corrected by tuning theinstruments and using few filters. But what’s fascinating about this feedbackloop phenomenon is that it pervades almost every other natural as well asman-made systems.

Solet’s explore this mental model i.e., Feedback Loop, and see how it can help usunderstand the world around us.

Hereis a working definition from Wikipedia –

Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputsas part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop. The systemcan then be said to feed back into itself.

In otherwords, in many systems, the output re-enters the system as another input. So afeedback loop is like an input, but its origin is from within the systemitself, not from outside the system.

Positive and Negative Feedback Loops

As we sawthat systems adjust in response to feedback. Feedback Loops can be positive ornegative. A positive feedback amplifies an effect, while a negative dampens it.

Athermostat is an example of negative feedback. In fact, the human body has anin-built thermostat. The tendency of human body, and for that matter all livingbeings, to maintain orderly conditions, including body temperature, is calledhomeostasis.

VictorNiederhoffer, in his book[[1\]](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-mental-models-feedback-loops/#note1), elaborates on this:

In system theory, it is called negative feedback … A commonhomeostatic behavior in humans is temperature regulation. If the temperaturerises above the 98.6 F optimum for normal human activity, sensors on the skindetect it and signal the brain that a rise has occurred. The brain relays theinformation to the effectors that increase blood flow to the skin. This inducesperspiration….[which on] evaporation lowers the body temperature. When the bodycools below a certain point, a comparable mechanism is set off, this timereducing blood flow and causing shivering. This activity generates heat throughphysical activity thus raising the body temperature.

Anegative feedback loop usually keeps the system in equilibrium whereas anuncontrolled positive feedback loop can cause a system to reach a criticalstate, a tipping point[[2\]](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-mental-models-feedback-loops/#note2), and then fundamentally change it.

If youwant to see positive feedback in action, stock market is great place. We willcome back to stock market shortly.

NuclearChain reaction

Positive- Spiral, runaway, vicious circle - business success - e.g. wall mart

- Bank Runs (Positive Feedback)
- Walmart - Low prices and high     volumes feed on each other 
- The Washington Post -     Dominant newspaper(Circulation and advertising feed on each other)     Positive Feedback
- Leverage in positive feedback     loops

Negative feedback:

Learning and Feedback Loops

Humanbehaviour can be improved to a great extent with the power of feedback loops.Experiential learning is one area where feedback loops play a terriblyimportant role.

In fact,the whole philosophy of deliberate practice is strongly based on the process ofgetting frequent quality feedback.

ElonMusk says –

I think it’s very important to have a feedback loop, where you’reconstantly thinking about what you’ve done and how you could be doing itbetter.

Ininvesting and in life, what makes all the difference is an ability to makeright decision. Right decision may not guarantee the desired outcome every timebut they increase your odds of success. Perfect decision-making is next toimpossible, and what matters more is forward momentum and a tight, fact-basedfeedback loop to quickly recognize and reverse bad decisions.

We haveto constantly incorporate feedback generated by our decisions and keepimproving the process.

Let metake a moment of yours and share my personal experience.

Myprimary purpose for writing the Latticework series, as I have been claiming inalmost all my previous posts, is to enhance my own learning. Now if you thinkabout it, the feedback loop model is very much applicable in my learningprocess also. How?

In orderto write, I need to read a lot. The more I read about a chosen topic, the moreinsights and ideas I stumble upon which results in an ever increasing list oftopics to learn (and write) about. So more reading results in more writing. Avirtuous cycle of learning, a nice feedback loop.

Complexity of Feedback Loops

Sofar, we have seen examples where the feedback produces somewhat predictableoutcome (positive or negative). But in many cases, especially in complexadaptive systems[[3\]](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-mental-models-feedback-loops/#note3), feedback loops can result wildunpredictable swings in system behaviour.

GeorgeSoros writes in his book –

I envision reflexivity as a feedback loop between participants’understanding and the situation in which they participate, and I contend thatthe concept of reflexivity is crucial to understanding the situation that havethinking participants. Reflexivity renders the participants’ imperfect andensures that their actions will have unintended consequences.

What itmeans is that changing one variable in a system will affect other variables inthat system and other systems. In systems such as economies, stock marketsetc., behaviour often changes as a result of the behaviour of others andexperiential learning (feedback loop). These systems therefore become difficultto predict as unexpected (emergent) properties may emerge.

It isunlikely therefore that history will exactly repeat itself as participants keepmodifying (learning with feedback loops) their behaviour.

So it’simportant to make the distinction as to what kind of systems are we dealingwith. Is it a system prone to cascading effects of positive feedback loops? Oris it a system which tends to remain at equilibrium by virtue of negativefeedback loops? Or is it a complex adaptive system prone to unintendedconsequences

Hereis a nice [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inVZoI1AkC8) illustration about different typesof feedback loop systems.

Whiletrying to predict the behaviour we must not only consider particular elementsof a design, but also their relation to the design as a whole and to thegreater environment.

Anotherimportant factor, while thinking about feedback loops, that needs to beconsidered is time lag between a feedback and its effect on the system.Feedback is a circle and it takes time to travel round a circle. This meansthat effects can appear some time after their cause.

Intheir book The Art of SystemsThinking[[4\]](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-mental-models-feedback-loops/#note4), the authors, Joseph O’Connor &Ian Mc Dermott, write –

Think of appetite as part of a feedback loop…there is a time delaybetween the stomach being full and the sensation of satisfaction…the feeling offullness is not directly related to how much food is in your stomach at thattime, but to how much food was in your stomach several minutes ago. This delaybetween being full and the sensation of being full means you may continue toeat past the satisfied stage to the uncomfortable stage. If you are stilleating when you feel full, you have gone too far. The way to avoid this is toeat more slowly, chewing well to speed the digestion of the sugars. Giveyourself time for the feedback to appear.

Not beingaware of this time delay can lead to faulty understanding of cause and effectin a system. When we do not take time delays into account we evaluate thesuccess of our strategies too soon, long before the full consequences areobserved.

In Business and Investing

The heartof value investing and long term wealth creation is the idea of compounding.

Whatmakes compounding interesting is that every small incremental change (intereston principal amount) goes back in the system (the principal amount) and becomesthe part of it which in turn generates a slightly bigger feedback (biggerinterest). Allow this to happen for a long time and what you have effectivelyis a positive feedback loop in action, a snowballing effect.

On thecontrary, dancing in and out of the market in response to every wiggle in thestock prices is akin to creating a negative feedback loop for your wealth. Thefrictional costs (taxes and brokerage) coupled with interrupted compoundingbrings back your system (wealth) into a stable (non-increasing) equilibriumposition.

So whatdo I do when my broker pushes me to trade? I look at it as a trigger fornegative feedback loop and I simply ignore him.

Whiletrying to understand a business, this mental model can be of tremendous use. Ifyou can figure out the kind of feedback loops operating for a business or anindustry, it can give you invaluable insights about the company.

Look atthe Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK) model. The humongous cash generated by BRK’sbusinesses is in the hands of world’s best capital allocator, Warren Buffett.He uses this cash to purchase other companies which in turn produces earningswhich are then used for buying other companies. This feedback loop has beenhappening at Berkshire for a very long time.

Prof.Sanjay Bakshi, in his interview[[5\]](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-mental-models-feedback-loops/#note5) with Safal Niveshak, mentioned –

Vicious circles can turn into virtuous ones and if you can get inbefore they do, on very favourable terms, then good things should happen, ifyou keep on doing it repeatedly.

A viciouscircle is positive feedback loop in a negative direction and a virtuous cycleis a one in positive direction causing snowballing effect.

You caneasily visualize a positive feedback loop in action during bull (or bear)markets. The stock market falls causes a sell-off. This creates a ripple effectof further sell-off and price declines. The opposite occurs in a stock marketbubble.

Ifound an interesting insight about nested positive and negative feedback loopsin this[[6\]](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-mental-models-feedback-loops/#note6) email exchange –

…you’re on the right track when you visualize a positive feedbackloop as a mechanism which is nested inside a negative feedback loop. Toillustrate, why do bear markets follow bull markets? Because over the long run,markets operate inside a negative feedback loop with built-in correctivemechanisms. When prices run too far away from underlying values, there areforces that pull them back.

So over along term the stock market shows characteristics of negative feedback loop i.e.the markets gradually go upwards with periodic corrections but in short term,especially during bubbles and crashes, it seems to be operating under theinfluence of positive feedback loops.

Thereare many other aspects of financial market which can be evaluated using thelens of feedback loops. Legendary value investor, Seth Klarman, used thismental model to explain the fallacy of indexing[[7\]](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-mental-models-feedback-loops/#note7). He says –

I believe that indexing will turn out to be just another Wall Streetfad. When it passes, the prices of securities included in popular indexes willalmost certainly decline relative to those that have been excluded.

More significantly, as Barron’s has pointed out, “A self-reinforcingfeedback loop has been created, where the success of indexing has bolstered theperformance of the index itself, which, in turn promotes more indexing.”

When the market trend reverses, matching the market will not seem soattractive, the selling will then adversely affect the performance of theindexers and further exacerbate the rush for the exits.

Conclusion

I havebeen extremely fortunate that I have this opportunity to expose my thoughts tothe Safal Niveshak Tribe. This is turning out to be my greatest learningexperience so far.

You canalso harness the power of feedback loops for your learning just by a clickof a button. I mean the comments section below.
