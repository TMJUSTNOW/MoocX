This isthe tendency of humans to overrate their decisions, possessions as well asabilities. Munger gives the example of Swedish divers, 90 percent of whom judgethemselves to be above average. This however cannot be true in real life. 

Thistendency also appears in the case of possessions. Says Munger, 'Even man'sminor possessions tend to be overappraised. Once owned, they suddenly becomeworth more to him than he would pay if they were offered for sale to him and hedidn't already own them. There is a name in psychology for thisoverappraise-your-own-possessions phenomenon: the 'endowment effect.''

TheRussian novelist and author of War and Peace (1869) once wrote of the power ofexcessive self-regard tendency. Munger says, 'According to Tolstoy, the worstcriminals don't appraise themselves as all that bad. They come to believeeither (1) that they didn't commit their crimes or (2) that, considering thepressures and disadvantages of their lives, it is understandable and forgivablethat they behaved as they did and became what they became.'

Excessiveself-regard is not all bad. It does have some positive benefits too. Mungersays, 'While an excess of self-regard is often counterproductive in its effectson cognition, it can cause some weird successes from overconfidence thathappens to cause success. This factor accounts for the adage: 'Neverunderestimate the man who overestimates himself.'

Ofcourse, some high self-appraisals are correct and serve better than falsemodesty. Moreover, self-regard in the form of a justified pride in a job welldone, or a life well lived, is a large constructive force. Without suchjustified pride, many more airplanes would crash.'

Impact 

In Life 

In Life:How many times you have heard parents go overboard praising their bright kids?Munger explains some of the worst incidences of the excessive self-regardtendency come into life when 'dysfunctional groups of cliquish persons,dominated by excessive self-regard tendency, select as new members of theirorganizations persons who are very much like themselves. Thus if the Englishdepartment at an elite university becomes mentally dysfunctional or the salesdepartment of a brokerage firm slips into routine fraud, the problem will havea natural tendency to get worse and to be quite resistant to change for thebetter.'

But thereis an antidote for falling into the excessive self-regard tendency. Accordingto Munger, 'The best antidote to folly from an excess of self-regard is toforce yourself to be more objective when you are thinking about yourself, yourfamily and friends, your property, and the value of your past and futureactivity. This isn't easy to do well and won't work perfectly, but it will workmuch better than simply letting psychological nature take its normal course.'

In investing 

Ininvesting: Sometimes after a good run in a bull market, we get lulled intobelieving that we are very good at the investing game, even though one of theprimary reasons for the good run could be the general market going up. SaysMunger, 'Intensify man's love of his own conclusions by adding the possessorywallop from the 'endowment effect,' and you will find that a man who hasalready bought a pork-belly future on a commodity exchange now foolishlybelieves, even more strongly than before, in the merits of his speculativebet.'
