Contrast Effect OR Perceptual Contrast ORContrast-Misreaction Tendency Definition 

This isthe tendency of humans to make bad decisions based on faulty comparisons. Theterm 'contrast' means to compare to see differences between two or moreproducts or services.

I’ll takeCharlie Munger’s help in defining this behavioural anomaly. This an excerptfrom his famous lecture on psychology of human misjudgement –

.. human nervous system can’t naturally measure in absolutescientific units, it must instead rely on something simpler. The eyes have asolution that limits their programming needs: the contrast in what is seen isregistered. And as in sight, so does it go, largely, in the other sense.Moreover, as perception goes, so goes cognition. The result is man’sContrast-Misreaction Tendency.

Cialdini's Sid and Harry

RobertCialdini, in his book [Influence](http://bit.ly/1cnq5Re), shares a story of two brothers, Sid and Harry, who owned a men’stailor shop.

Whenever the salesman, Sid, had a new customer trying on suits infront of the shop’s three-sided mirror, he would admit to a hearing problem,and, as they talked, he would repeatedly request that the man speak more loudlyto him. Once the customer had found a suit he liked and had asked for theprice, Sid would call to his brother, the head tailor, at the back of the room,“Harry, how much for this suit?”

Looking up from his work — and greatly exaggerating the suit’s true price — Harry would call back, “For that beautiful all-woolsuit, forty-two dollars.” Pretending not to have heard and cupping his hand tohis ear, Sid would ask again. Once more Harry would reply, “Forty-two dollars.”At this point, Sid would turn to the customer and report, “He says twenty-twodollars.”

Many a man would hurry to buy the suit and scramble out of the shopwith his “expensive = good” bargain before Poor Sid discovered the “mistake”.

Well, Sidand Harry made their moolah even as the customer thought he got a ‘great’ deal!:)

Nowconsider your own experiences. Have you ever realized that if you lift a lightobject first and then lift a heavy object, you will estimate the second objectto be heavier than if you had lifted it without first trying the light one? Ifnot, try it out now.

Lift aheavy object. Then lift a light object. Then lift that heavy object again. Youwill find the heavy object heavier after you picked up the light object.

In theimage here, the two inner rectangles are exactly the same shade of grey, butthe right one appears to be a lighter grey than the left one due to thebackground provided by the outer rectangles. It’s the result of contrasteffect.

Contrast Effect and Dots in Image 

Now lookat this image below. The black dots you see are fleeting, and any individualdot will turn white as soon as you focus on it. Clearly, all the dots areactually white, yet at a glance we still perceive some of them as being black.

Thisis due to a principle in human perception, called the Contrast Effect,which affects the way we see the difference between two things that arepresented one after another. Wikipedia writes…

Contrast effects can shape not only visual qualities like color andbrightness, but other kinds of perception, including the perception of weight.

One experiment found that thinking of the name “Hitler” led tosubjects rating a person as more friendly.

Whether a piece of music is perceived as good or bad can depend onwhether the music heard before it was unpleasant or pleasant.

For the effect to work, the objects being compared need to besimilar to each other: a television reporter can seem to shrink wheninterviewing a tall basketball player, but not when standing next to a tallbuilding.

Contrast Effect and Appearance of People 

Thecontrast affect also works when we are studying physical appearances of people. Alarge body of research investigating attractiveness reflects the importance ofphysical appearance.

Despitecommon phrases such as ‘beauty is only skin deep,’ there is no longer any doubtthat being attractive has societal benefits.

Attractiveindividuals are consistently treated significantly better than theirunattractive counterparts. Additionally, attractive adults are judged morepositively in occupational competence than unattractive counterparts, and areperceived as higher in social appeal, psychological adjustment, andinterpersonal competence.

Theseresults hold true even when familiarity is taken into account. Not only areopinions influenced by attractiveness, but behavior towards attractive childrenand adults echo the importance of being physically attractive.

Soif you are talking to a beautiful woman at a party and are then joined by anunattractive one, the second woman will strike you as less attractive than sheactually is. In his book [Influence](http://bit.ly/1cnq5Re), Cialdini shows the working ofthe contrast effect through an experiment…

Each student takes a turn sitting in front of three pails of water – one cold, one at room temperature and onehot.

After placing one hand in the cold water and one in the hot water,the student is told to place both in the lukewarm water simultaneously. Thelook of amused bewilderment that immediately registers tells the story: Eventhough both hands are in the same bucket, the hand that has been in the coldwater feels as if it is now in hot water, while the hand that was in hot waterfeels as if is now in cold water.

The point is that the same thing – in this instance, room-temperature water – can be made to seem verydifferent, depending on the nature of the event that precedes it.

CharlieMunger writes – “Our sensory apparatus does not have anabsolute change. It has got a contrast scale. It takes a certain percentagechange before it notices the change.”

Cialdinishows the contrast effect through another example – this one you must have definitely facedin your life…

Suppose a man enters a fashionable men’s store and says that hewants to buy a three-piece suit and a sweater. If you were the salesperson,which would you show him first to make him likely to spend the most money?

Clothing stores instruct their sales personnel to sell the costlyitem first. Common sense might suggest the reverse: If a man has just spent alot of money to purchase a suit, he may be reluctant to spend very much more onthe purchase of a sweater. 

But the clothiers know better. Theybehave in accordance with what the contrast principle would suggest: Sell thesuit first, because when it comes time to look at sweaters, even expensiveones, their prices will not seem as high in comparison. A man might balk at theidea of spending 95forasweater,butifhehasjustboughta95forasweater,butifhehasjustboughta495 suit, a $95 sweater does not seemexcessive.

This veryprinciple is at work when the car salesman sells you “inexpensive” accessoriesjust after you buy a car.

Here’sone more example of contrasteffect. You think Bollywood actor Sunny Deol was a baddancer? Well, watch Sunny’s dance in [this video](http://youtu.be/4SN9smTDr6M) (the first 2 minutes), and then watch [this video](http://youtu.be/LYUBL4cWSO8).

You willknow how, in contrast, Sunny was such a great dancer! :)

Anyways,in Psychology of HumanMisjudgment, Charlie Munger gave an analogy of the‘boiling frog syndrome’. He said…

If you throw a frog into very hot water, the frog will jump out, butif you put the frog in room temperature water and just slowly heat the waterup, the frog will die there. 

Now I don’t know whether that’s true about a frog, but it’s sure ashell true about many of the businessmen I know, and there, again, it is thecontrast phenomenon. But these are hotshot, high-powered people. I mean theseare not fools.

If it comes to you in small pieces, you’re likely to miss, so ifyou’re going to be a person of good judgment, you have to do something aboutthis warp in your head where it’s so misled by mere contrast.

It’s all Relative

Is itpossible to influence customer’s decisions by manipulating the availableoptions?

Theanswer is a resounding yes.

 

[Dan Ariely - Economist Subscription options](http://k2invest.blogspot.in/2016/01/dan-ariely-economist-subscription.html)

Inferior and Elegant Pen

Consider this experiment where a group of people was asked to choosebetween 6cashandanelegantpen.Mostchoosethecash.Anothergroupofpeoplewasaskedtochoosebetween6cashandanelegantpen.Mostchoosethecash.Anothergroupofpeoplewasaskedtochoosebetween6 cash, the elegant pen, or an inferiorpen. Most choose the elegant pen. Why?

By addingan inferior option, a decoy if you will, which nobody chooses, people aresubtly nudged towards the option (the elegant pen in this case) which can becompared to the inferior choice.

 

Decoys in comparable 

Exampleof 2nd most expensive wine on the menu - the most expensive is the decoy whichis supposed to make the 2nd most expensive (and very profitable for therestaurant) wine look better than the cheaper ones and good value compared tothe most expensive one.

Buying a Lamp VS Buying a Car

Inavailability bias - this was about anchoring - You were anchoring to price oflamp and price of car and NOT anchoring to wealth. Here its about contrast -high contrast - the Rs 1000 saving on a lamp looks BIG but SMALL in a car.

How Real Estate Agents Fool You

Realestate agents who help put out homes on rent use the contrast effectvery well. Try searching for a rented accommodation and you will know.

The agentwould first take you around and show a couple of apartments which are not inthe best of condition. While coming out of these places, seeing yourdispleasure, the agent would typically say that the apartments he showed youweren’t really great.

When youask why he showed you those bad apartments, he would reply that he had himselfnot seen the place as they were new listings. It is then that the agent wouldshow you a place that is slightly better than the few uninhabitable places hehad shown you a little earlier. But the difference is that the rent for this“better” apartment would be significantly higher.

Thisis contrast effect at work. The attractiveness of the apartment shown later willincrease significantly for you given that the broker showed you a few“extremely bad” apartments earlier, and you would be more than happy paying thebroker a hefty commission for the great “deal”.

 

Buying Car

The storyisn’t much different when we end up buying that overpriced ₹25,000 leatheraccessory merely because the price is so low compared to our concurrentpurchase of a ₹5 lacs car.

Even whenpeople know that this sort of customer manipulation is being attempted, it willoften work to trigger buying, which demonstrates that being aware ofpsychological ploys is not a perfect defence.

 

Infact the ‘predictability about our irrational behaviour’ was the premise onwhich Dan Ariely wrote his entertaining book, [Predictably Irrational](http://amzn.to/15LW1w9). In the following talk, Dan shows you some optical illusions tobring home the point that awareness about human biases doesn’t necessarily makeyou immune to them.

 

Ona lighter note, [RolfDobelli](http://bit.ly/17ojyGh) suggests that if you are seeking a partner,never go out in the company of your supermodel friends. People will find youless attractive than you really are. Go alone or, better yet, take two uglyfriends. I haven’t validated this trick, so goes without saying –“try it atyour own risk!” :)There is another aspect of CMT which makes it veryinteresting. If we fail to perceive the change, due to small contrast, themis-reaction may not trigger at all. For example, our kids grow up right infront of our eyes but we notice the change only when we look at old pictures.

 

Contrast Effect and Investing

The wholeidea behind systematic investment plan (SIP) is that a small outgo (as comparedto the whole salary) every month from our paycheque doesn’t pinch.

As wehave seen contrast is a two sided sword, and its ill effects show up ininvesting also.

Have youheard of “Big Bath” accounting? For the uninitiated it’s an accounting juggleryto “manage” a company’s earnings. Sometimes, to fool the shareholders, aparticular year’s poor income statement is made to look even worse byincreasing expenses and selling assets.

As aresult, the subsequent years, especially the very next, appear much better incontrast.

Satyam’scase is another example which shows how big accounting scams are created.

Here iswhat Ramalinga Raju’s aides at Satyam must have told him before the scam cameto light – “If we slowly and gradually over time manipulate the numbers, theauditors won’t notice it.”

Incidentally,in this case, even the auditors were involved! But the Satyam scam did not cometo light till Raju confessed of riding a tiger.

You see,contrasts may blind us to change until it’s too late. For example, we oftendon’t notice the bad behaviour of others (like we ignore “small” accountingmanipulations at companies) if it goes sour gradually over time. Often we seereality as constant, although it gradually changes.

Similarly,we fail to notice how our money disappears. It constantly loses its value, butwe do not notice because inflation happens over time. If it were imposed on usin the form of a brutal tax (and basically that’s what it is), we would beoutraged.

Anotherarea where CMT can harm is our fixation on the stock price. When you areanalysing a business, it becomes extremely hard to overcome the temptation toignore the past stock price trends. If a stock has risen recently, oursubconscious screams that the stock has become expensive. A recent fall inprice triggers the CMT which convinces us that the stock has become cheaper.

Myadvice? Don’t look at the stock price until you have analysed the business andworked out some valuation. For that matter, if you can’t avoid price basedscreeners, use them carefully.

 Averagingdown is a good idea but like most good ideas, if they are carried to theextreme, become bad ideas…Blind averaging down can be injurious to your(ﬁnancial) health.

 

Justbecause a stock has fallen 80%, doesn’t necessarily make it cheap and worthy ofaveraging down.You may be catching a falling knife.

Munger:

“Cognition, misled by tiny changes involving low contrast, willoften miss a trend that is destiny.”

You’vejust got to acquire the skill to spot long-term trends - even if they are slow-indeed PARTICULARLY because they are slow because OTHERS who are victims of lowcontrast are going to MISS IT.

Whatis the relationship between contrasteffect and investing? There’s a lot.

EastmanKodak Company, commonly known as Kodak, is an American multinational imagingand photographic equipment company headquartered in New York, founded in 1880by George Eastman.

- “You press the button, we do     the rest,” was its slogan in 1888. 
- In 1976, it accounted for 90%     of the film and 85% of camera sales in America. 
- In 1988, the company had     145,000 employees. 
- Until 1990, it was regularly     rated one of the world’s five most valuable brands. 
- In 1996, had revenue of $16     billion. 
- In 1999, it had $2.5 billion     in profits. 
- In 2012, revenues were $4.1     billion. Down more than 75% from 1996. If you take the effect of inflation     it was much lower. 
- In 2012, it lost 1.3billioncomparedto1999profitsof1.3billioncomparedto1999profitsof2.5 billion. 
- In 2012, the company filed     bankruptcy. 

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/BD7BD8F0-19D4-D54B-9098-34303DFDD573.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JIAJlrMymog/Vn0vVT14htI/AAAAAAAA5Oc/M-p1Cvhz-1s/s1600/contrast-effect-kodak-downfall.png)

Whathappened? The industry slowly shifted from film to digital photography. Kodakwas slow to adapt. Why? The margins on the film are 70 cents on a dollarcompared to 5 cents on a dollar on digital.

Kodak wasslow to adapt to this change. Eventually it built a business on digitalcameras. What happened then? It lasted only for few years before phones withcameras came and killed it.

Imagineyourself owing the stock of Kodak from 1990. You look at its stock price everyday. Do you think you would have spotted the bankruptcy? It was very hard! 

Why? Whenthe business changes very slowly you are not going to spot the change if youare following it on a daily basis. The reason is because on a day-to-day basisyou will have more noise than signal. It is very hard to extract signal fromthe noise. Hence you will better off reading the annual report of the companyonce a year and forming your judgment. How many of us will do?

Rememberwhat Charlie Munger said…

If it comes to you in small pieces, you’re likely to miss, so ifyou’re going to be a person of good judgment, you have to do something aboutthis warp in your head where it’s so misled by mere contrast.

Buffettin his 1998 speech sensed the troubles of Kodak…

30 years ago, Eastman Kodak’s moat was just as wide as Coca-Cola’smoat. I mean if you were going to take a picture of your six-month old baby andyou want to look at that picture 20 years from now or 50 years from now. Andyou are never going to get a chance—you are not a professional photographer—soyou can evaluate what is going to look good 20 or 50 years ago. 

What is in your mind about that photography company (share of mind)is what counts? Because they are promising you that the picture you take todayis going to be terrific 20 to 50 years from now about something that is veryimportant to you. Well, Kodak had that in spades 30 years ago, they owned that.They had what I call share of mind. Forget about share of market, share ofmind. They had something—that little yellow box—that said Kodak is the best.That is priceless. 

They have lost some of that. They haven’t lost it all.

MTNL 

In India,one company that comes to mind is MTNL, once a leading telecom company and nowjust surviving on government’s whims.

MTNL wasthe leading telecom services provider in Delhi and Mumbai, two of India’sleading consumers of telecom minutes then (and even now). However, even asprivate mobile telephone companies started to dent MTNL’s hegemony in these twocities, the company continued to focus on “landlines” instead of moving wheretechnology and demand were moving.

Theresult, sales have fallen from Rs 58 billion to Rs 34 billion over 10 years,while the company is into a deep loss of Rs 52 billion as of now, compared toprofit of Rs 9 billion in 2003.

 

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/9BD2C7EC-6BDB-494B-AE47-47B1D8C3816F.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nAjvkEvYixc/Vn0vbsgeSKI/AAAAAAAA5Ok/vdsdlaf7Jwc/s1600/contrast-effect-mtnl.png)

MTNL’sfall from grace has not been drastic, but gradual. Thus, if you had been ashareholder in the company, you may not have seen the fall happening over theyears. Some of the industries I see gradually moving into the same line as MTNLare newspaper publishing, and apparel manufacturing. Watch out if you ownstocks from there!

Movingfrom decline in businesses to decline in stocks, we often look at stock pricesnot in isolation but in contrast to where they were in the past. So a lot ofinvestors search for stocks in the 52-week low or 52-week high lists.

While Iam not suggesting here whether these strategies are good or bad, what I amsaying is that your decision to buy or avoid a stock “today” is not dependent,in any way, on where the stock was a week, or month, or year back. Forinstance, look at these three charts of SAIL, Opto Circuits, and DeccanChronicle respectively…

Aftereach fall, a new investor looking to invest in the stock would have beenenticed to buy thinking that the stock was “cheaper” in contrast to a week ormonth back. As for an existing investor, he would have used each fall toaverage down his cost price (a lot of people do that!). While it’s always goodto be a contrarian and buy good businesses that are out of favour and thusselling cheap, it’s dangerous to make your decision just based on that factthat “the stock is cheaper now than it was a month back!”

Thisexample associates well with Anchoring Bias that we discussed in [Lesson 9](http://k2invest.blogspot.in/2014/12/availability-bias.html). But who said biases work inisolation? You are, in fact, affected by several of them at one time. We willstudy this in Lesson 19.

Contrast effect in Life

A husbandwho marries for the second time will often compare his new wife with his firstwife. That comparison is incorrect. Moreover, if the husband bases anydecisions on this comparison, it could have disastrous results on his existingmarriage.

Oftenfound in: Decisions based on two or more alternatives.

In Life:Munger explains how real estate agents misuse this tendency. 'A particularlyreprehensible form of sales practice occurs in the offices of some real estatebrokers. A buyer from out of the city, perhaps needing to shift his familythere, visits the office with little time available. The salesman deliberatelyshows the customer three awful houses at ridiculously high prices. Then heshows him a merely bad house at a price only moderately too high. And, boom,the broker often makes an easy sale.'

 

Contrast Effect in Corporations

Incorporations: The contrast- misreaction tendency is used by connivingcorporations to make the illusion that products on offer give a good deal tothe customer. This is, however, far from the truth. In a very recent example,Flipkart, one of the country's leading online retailers was found to quote aninflated MRP of `799 for a pair of wedges (sandals). The retailer subsequentlyoffered a 50 per cent discount, pricing the sandal at `399. A close inspectionof the photo reveals that the sandal has a printed MRP of `399, making theeffective discount zero. But unsuspecting customers could get away thinkingthat they got a good deal. The power of the contrast-misreaction tendency comesinto play when even after knowing of such manipulative practices, customersstill flock to buy.

 

Contrast Effect and Big Bath Accounting

Away companies use the contrasteffect to fool shareholders is by undertaking what isknown as “Big Bath” – an accounting jugglery that helps a company “manage” itsearnings. In simple words, bigbath is the practice of making a particular year’s poorincome statement look even worse by increasing expenses and selling assets. 

Subsequentyears – especially the verynext – will then appear muchbetter in contrast.

Usingbig bath, a one-time charge –or a write-off – is takenagainst income in order to reduce assets, which results in lower expenses inthe future.

Thewrite-off removes or reduces the asset from the financial books and results inlower net income for that year. The objective is to ‘take one big bath’ in asingle year so future years, in contrast, will show increased net income.

Thistechnique is often employed in a year when sales are down from other externalfactors and the company would report a loss in any event.

Forexample, inventory (finished goods not sold at the end of the year) valued onthe books at Rs 100 per item is written down to Rs 50 per item resulting in anet loss of Rs 50 per item in the current year.

Notethere is no cash impact to this write-down. When that same inventory is sold inlater years for Rs 75 per item, the company reports an income of Rs 25 per item(Rs 75 minus Rs 50) in the future period. This process takes an inventory lossand turns it into a ‘profit’.

Companieswill often wait until a bad year to employ this ‘big bath’ technique to ‘cleanup’ the balance sheet. Although the process is discouraged by auditors, it isstill used.

Oneexample of an Indian company using big bath accounting to show a remarkableturnaround is that of TataMotors.

At thetime of launching ‘Indica’ in 2001-02, the company spent Rs 1,178 crore on thelaunch process. However, the company treated this as a “developmentexpenditure” that was to be spread over a number of years instead of the yearsin which it was incurred (2001-02).

It thuswrote-off the entire amount from its “Securities Premium Account” that is shownin the Balance Sheet, and which helped it avoid showing the expense in itsProfit & Loss account.

Thanks tothis, the company showed a net loss during 2001-02 of just Rs 53 crore ascompared to a loss of Rs 500 crore in the previous year (2000-01). If thisexpenditure of Rs 1,178 crore was shown on the P&L Account, the net lossfor 2001-02 would have been more than double of that in 2000-01.

Ina press release, the company accepted that “…the initiative will enable the Balance Sheet to represent “better”operational results in the future years and the true shareholder value.”

Mahindra & Mahindra, which launched“Scorpio” in 2002-03, took hints from what Tata Motors did and took a big bathon its own accounts, thereby showing a remarkable performance in that year ofScorpio’s launch, in “contrast” to the previous year.

 

 

How Accounting Scams are Created

“If weslowly and gradually over time manipulate the numbers, the auditors won’tnotice it.”

This iswhat Ramalinga Raju’s aides at Satyam must have told him before the scam cameto light. Incidentally, in this case, even the auditors were involved!

You see,contrasts may blind us to change until it’s too late. For example, we oftendon’t notice the bad behavior of others if it goes sour gradually over time.Often we see reality as constant, although it gradually changes.

Sometimesit is the small, gradual, invisible changes that harm us the most.

WarrenBuffett says…

One of the problems in society is that the most important issues areoften these incremental type things. The world is not going to come to an endbecause tomorrow there are 200 or 250 thousand more people on the planet thanthere were today. That’s about the number it grows every day…it is like eatingabout 300 calories more each day than you burn up; it has no effect on youtoday. You don’t get up from the table and all of a sudden everybody says, “MyGod, you look fat compared to when you sat down!”

But, if you keep doing it over time, the incremental problems arehard to attack because that one extra piece of pie doesn’t really seem to makea difference. The 250,000 people tomorrow don’t seem to make any difference,but the cumulative effects of them will make a huge difference over time, justlike overeating will make a huge difference over time. The time to attack thoseproblems is early.

Unlikepeople, companies can in theory live forever. But most die young, because thecorporate world, unlike society at large, is a fight to the death.

Thus,when we study the concept of “moats”, we will try to understand how to findcompanies that survive longer than others.

Finally,here’s something important for your life, and investing life, that Rolf Dobelliwrites in [The Art ofThinking Clearly](http://bit.ly/13N716K)…

When we encounter contrasts, we react like birds to a gunshot: wejump up and get moving. Our weak spot: we don’t notice small, gradual changes.A magician can make your watch vanish because, when he presses on one part ofyour body, you don’t notice the lighter touch on your wrist as he relieves youof your Rolex.

Similarly, we fail to notice how our money disappears. It constantlyloses its value, but we do not notice because inflation happens over time. Ifit were imposed on us in the form of a brutal tax (and basically that’s what itis), we would be outraged.

The contrasteffect can ruin your whole life: a charming womanmarries a fairly average man. But because her parents were awful people, theordinary man appears to be a prince.

Today, wehave the technology to retouch pictures of people. So, it’s easy to “create”perfect appearances even when the reality is not so perfect…and especially whenthe reality is not so perfect.

Beautysells, and this is most people are trying to do – either via making up their appearances or making up their financialstatements. For you, it means an extra care is needed while looking at people,things, and financial statements that look very beautiful.

It alsomeans you are more beautiful than you think, and especially when you compareyourself to the “made-up” people out there. Now, isn’t that a self confidenceboost for you, dear friend? 

 

Noise VS Signal

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/27FEB1B9-C89A-0D49-8B91-62C679DE6879.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MFjeVpzZFKs/VoZB4CnAvwI/AAAAAAAA51c/FWBWTa0UvI8/s1600/nassim_taleb.jpg)

The more frequently you look at data, the more noise you aredisproportionally likely to get (rather than the valuable part called thesignal); hence the higher the noise to signal ratio. And there is a confusion,that is not psychological at all, but inherent in the data itself. Say you lookat information on a yearly basis, for stock prices or the fertilizer sales ofyour father-in-law’s factory, or inﬂationnumbers in Vladivostock. Assumefurther that for what you are observing, at the yearly frequency the ratio ofsignal to noise is about one to one (say half noise, half signal) —it meansthat about half of changes are real improvements or degradations, the otherhalf comes from randomness. This ratio is what you get from yearlyobservations. But if you look at the very same data on a daily basis, thecomposition would change to 95% noise, 5% signal. And if you observe data on anhourly basis, as people immersed in the news and markets price variations do,the split becomes 99.5% noise to .5%signal. That is two hundred times morenoise than signal —which is why anyone who listens to news(except when very,very significant events take place) is one step below sucker.

This is afantastic description of markets from Ben Graham’s Security Analysis.

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/C44629AC-BAB3-784D-A10F-3823AEF66467.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GBUEd3yZraE/VodvsZaiZjI/AAAAAAAA57k/e8JqfTIYyGQ/s1600/intrinsic_value_factors_relation_to_market_price.jpg)

 Ittells you what you need to IGNORE and what you need to FOCUS on.  Thereare only a FEW things out there that are important. All the rest is NOISE.

Grahamand Dodd then shrewdly observed that “it will be evident from the chart thatthe influence of what we call analytical factors over the market price is both partial and indirect –partial, because it frequently competes with purely speculative factors whichinfluence the price in the opposite direction; and indirect, because it actsthrough the intermediary of people’s sentiments and decisions.

 

Contrast, the Invisible Killer

Contrastsmakes us blind to slow change until it’s too late. The reality around us seemspretty much constant, although it’s continuously changing. The change in astimulus has to cross a certain threshold before our awareness can register it.

It’sworth mentioning here a tremendously useful mental model from Charlie Munger’sLatticework called boiling frog syndrome, described by Prof Bakshi in thiswonderful [blog post](http://goo.gl/RjsuQP). He explains –

Small incremental changes tend to go unnoticed…If you put a frog inhot boiling water, he will instantly leap out of the pan and be never seenagain. But, if you put a frog in a pan with room temperature water and slowlyturn up the heat, he wouldn’t be able to tell the tiny incremental changes. Hewill boil and die.

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/A87993F7-3AD1-1F48-A361-78C0B49BD0D8.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GnVQCURzmBs/VnJXgF5lEFI/AAAAAAAA4vw/SvD-rsHFOuA/s1600/frog_in_boiling_water_syndrome.png)

CharlieMunger once said that many businesses die just like the boiling frog.Cognition, misled by tiny changes involving low contrast, will often miss atrend that is destiny. He further warns – 

When a man’s steps are consecutively taken toward disaster with eachstep being very small, the brain’s Contrast-Misreaction Tendency will often letthe man go too far toward disaster to be able to avoid it. This happens becauseeach step presents so small a contrast from his present position.

To asmall stimulus, only a small amount must be added. To a larger stimulus, alarge amount must be added.

WarrenBuffett says –

One of the problems in society is that the most important issues areoften these incremental type things…But, if you keep doing it over time, theincremental problems are hard to attack because that one extra piece of piedoesn’t really seem to make a difference…but the cumulative effects of themwill make a huge difference over time, just like overeating will make a hugedifference over time. The time to attack those problems is early.

Sometimesit is the small, gradual, invisible changes that harm us the most.

 

Conclusion

Understandthat CMT is everywhere, and that we view our world through its lens – rose coloured or otherwise.

Fewpsychological tendencies do more damage to correct thinking than CMT. WarrenBuffett was probably referring to contrast bias when he said –

Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy tobe broken.

It’sinteresting that most bad habits are formed because of this tendency butfortunately this bias, if used intelligently, can help us form good habits too.John Wooden, one of the most successful coaches in the history of basketball,observed –

When you improve a little each day, eventually big things occur …Don’t look for big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at atime. That’s the only way it happens and when it happens, it lasts.

I wantedto tell my friend, Mr. Irrational, that he was taken for a ride by his tailorsbut then I thought to myself, “Let me keep the poor kid happy.” After all hestill believes that he stole a great deal.

But youdon’t forget to include CMT in your mental model checklist. And at the sametime don’t forget to make use of it for creating good habits.

Take careand keep learning.

  This isthe tendency of humans to make bad decisions based on faulty comparisons. Theterm 'contrast' means to compare to see differences between two or moreproducts or services.

  I’ll takeCharlie Munger’s help in defining this behavioural anomaly. This an excerptfrom his famous lecture on psychology of human misjudgement –

  .. human nervous system can’t naturally measure in absolutescientific units, it must instead rely on something simpler. The eyes have asolution that limits their programming needs: the contrast in what is seen isregistered. And as in sight, so does it go, largely, in the other sense.Moreover, as perception goes, so goes cognition. The result is man’sContrast-Misreaction Tendency.

  Cialdini's Sid and Harry

  RobertCialdini, in his book [Influence](http://bit.ly/1cnq5Re), shares a story of two brothers, Sid and Harry, who owned a men’stailor shop.

  Whenever the salesman, Sid, had a new customer trying on suits infront of the shop’s three-sided mirror, he would admit to a hearing problem,and, as they talked, he would repeatedly request that the man speak more loudlyto him. Once the customer had found a suit he liked and had asked for theprice, Sid would call to his brother, the head tailor, at the back of the room,“Harry, how much for this suit?”

  Looking up from his work — and greatly exaggerating the suit’s true price — Harry would call back, “For that beautiful all-woolsuit, forty-two dollars.” Pretending not to have heard and cupping his hand tohis ear, Sid would ask again. Once more Harry would reply, “Forty-two dollars.”At this point, Sid would turn to the customer and report, “He says twenty-twodollars.”

  Many a man would hurry to buy the suit and scramble out of the shopwith his “expensive = good” bargain before Poor Sid discovered the “mistake”.

  Well, Sidand Harry made their moolah even as the customer thought he got a ‘great’ deal!:)

  Nowconsider your own experiences. Have you ever realized that if you lift a lightobject first and then lift a heavy object, you will estimate the second objectto be heavier than if you had lifted it without first trying the light one? Ifnot, try it out now.

  Lift aheavy object. Then lift a light object. Then lift that heavy object again. Youwill find the heavy object heavier after you picked up the light object.

  Contrast Effect and Dots in Image 

  Now lookat this image below. The black dots you see are fleeting, and any individualdot will turn white as soon as you focus on it. Clearly, all the dots areactually white, yet at a glance we still perceive some of them as being black.

  Thisis due to a principle in human perception, called the Contrast Effect,which affects the way we see the difference between two things that arepresented one after another. Wikipedia writes…

  Contrast effects can shape not only visual qualities like color andbrightness, but other kinds of perception, including the perception of weight.

  One experiment found that thinking of the name “Hitler” led tosubjects rating a person as more friendly.

  Whether a piece of music is perceived as good or bad can depend onwhether the music heard before it was unpleasant or pleasant.

  For the effect to work, the objects being compared need to besimilar to each other: a television reporter can seem to shrink wheninterviewing a tall basketball player, but not when standing next to a tallbuilding.

  Contrast Effect and Appearance of People 

  Thecontrast affect also works when we are studying physical appearances of people. Alarge body of research investigating attractiveness reflects the importance ofphysical appearance.

  Despitecommon phrases such as ‘beauty is only skin deep,’ there is no longer any doubtthat being attractive has societal benefits.

  Attractiveindividuals are consistently treated significantly better than theirunattractive counterparts. Additionally, attractive adults are judged morepositively in occupational competence than unattractive counterparts, and areperceived as higher in social appeal, psychological adjustment, andinterpersonal competence.

  Theseresults hold true even when familiarity is taken into account. Not only areopinions influenced by attractiveness, but behavior towards attractive childrenand adults echo the importance of being physically attractive.

   

  [![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/BE5D9DCA-8883-2642-B23F-0C9CAD896C52.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9pWxaJfYRZ4/Vn0u5bSfryI/AAAAAAAA5OE/n9-dUthO_N4/s1600/contrast-effect-JassiJaisiKoiNahi.png)

  Soif you are talking to a beautiful woman at a party and are then joined by anunattractive one, the second woman will strike you as less attractive than sheactually is. In his book [Influence](http://bit.ly/1cnq5Re), Cialdini shows the working ofthe contrast effect through an experiment…

  Each student takes a turn sitting in front of three pails of water – one cold, one at room temperature and onehot.

  After placing one hand in the cold water and one in the hot water,the student is told to place both in the lukewarm water simultaneously. Thelook of amused bewilderment that immediately registers tells the story: Eventhough both hands are in the same bucket, the hand that has been in the coldwater feels as if it is now in hot water, while the hand that was in hot waterfeels as if is now in cold water.

  The point is that the same thing – in this instance, room-temperature water – can be made to seem verydifferent, depending on the nature of the event that precedes it.

  CharlieMunger writes – “Our sensory apparatus does not have anabsolute change. It has got a contrast scale. It takes a certain percentagechange before it notices the change.”

  Cialdinishows the contrast effect through another example – this one you must have definitely facedin your life…

  Suppose a man enters a fashionable men’s store and says that hewants to buy a three-piece suit and a sweater. If you were the salesperson,which would you show him first to make him likely to spend the most money?

  Clothing stores instruct their sales personnel to sell the costlyitem first. Common sense might suggest the reverse: If a man has just spent alot of money to purchase a suit, he may be reluctant to spend very much more onthe purchase of a sweater. 

  But the clothiers know better. Theybehave in accordance with what the contrast principle would suggest: Sell thesuit first, because when it comes time to look at sweaters, even expensiveones, their prices will not seem as high in comparison. A man might balk at theidea of spending 95forasweater,butifhehasjustboughta95forasweater,butifhehasjustboughta495 suit, a $95 sweater does not seemexcessive.

  This veryprinciple is at work when the car salesman sells you “inexpensive” accessoriesjust after you buy a car.

  You willknow how, in contrast, Sunny was such a great dancer! :)

  Anyways,in Psychology of HumanMisjudgment, Charlie Munger gave an analogy of the‘boiling frog syndrome’. He said…

  If you throw a frog into very hot water, the frog will jump out, butif you put the frog in room temperature water and just slowly heat the waterup, the frog will die there. 

  Now I don’t know whether that’s true about a frog, but it’s sure ashell true about many of the businessmen I know, and there, again, it is thecontrast phenomenon. But these are hotshot, high-powered people. I mean theseare not fools.

  If it comes to you in small pieces, you’re likely to miss, so ifyou’re going to be a person of good judgment, you have to do something aboutthis warp in your head where it’s so misled by mere contrast.

  It’s all Relative

  Is itpossible to influence customer’s decisions by manipulating the availableoptions?

  Theanswer is a resounding yes.

   

  [Dan Ariely - Economist Subscription options](http://k2invest.blogspot.in/2016/01/dan-ariely-economist-subscription.html)

  Inferior and Elegant Pen

  Consider this experiment where a group of people was asked to choosebetween 6cashandanelegantpen.Mostchoosethecash.Anothergroupofpeoplewasaskedtochoosebetween6cashandanelegantpen.Mostchoosethecash.Anothergroupofpeoplewasaskedtochoosebetween6 cash, the elegant pen, or an inferiorpen. Most choose the elegant pen. Why?

  By addingan inferior option, a decoy if you will, which nobody chooses, people aresubtly nudged towards the option (the elegant pen in this case) which can becompared to the inferior choice.

   

  Decoys in comparable 

  Exampleof 2nd most expensive wine on the menu - the most expensive is the decoy whichis supposed to make the 2nd most expensive (and very profitable for therestaurant) wine look better than the cheaper ones and good value compared tothe most expensive one.

  Buying a Lamp VS Buying a Car

  Inavailability bias - this was about anchoring - You were anchoring to price oflamp and price of car and NOT anchoring to wealth. Here its about contrast -high contrast - the Rs 1000 saving on a lamp looks BIG but SMALL in a car.

  How Real Estate Agents Fool You

  Realestate agents who help put out homes on rent use the contrast effectvery well. Try searching for a rented accommodation and you will know.

  The agentwould first take you around and show a couple of apartments which are not inthe best of condition. While coming out of these places, seeing yourdispleasure, the agent would typically say that the apartments he showed youweren’t really great.

  When youask why he showed you those bad apartments, he would reply that he had himselfnot seen the place as they were new listings. It is then that the agent wouldshow you a place that is slightly better than the few uninhabitable places hehad shown you a little earlier. But the difference is that the rent for this“better” apartment would be significantly higher.

  Thisis contrast effect at work. The attractiveness of the apartment shown later willincrease significantly for you given that the broker showed you a few“extremely bad” apartments earlier, and you would be more than happy paying thebroker a hefty commission for the great “deal”.

   

  Buying Car

  The storyisn’t much different when we end up buying that overpriced ₹25,000 leatheraccessory merely because the price is so low compared to our concurrentpurchase of a ₹5 lacs car.

  Even whenpeople know that this sort of customer manipulation is being attempted, it willoften work to trigger buying, which demonstrates that being aware ofpsychological ploys is not a perfect defence.

   

  Infact the ‘predictability about our irrational behaviour’ was the premise onwhich Dan Ariely wrote his entertaining book, [Predictably Irrational](http://amzn.to/15LW1w9). In the following talk, Dan shows you some optical illusions tobring home the point that awareness about human biases doesn’t necessarily makeyou immune to them.

   

  Ona lighter note, [RolfDobelli](http://bit.ly/17ojyGh) suggests that if you are seeking a partner,never go out in the company of your supermodel friends. People will find youless attractive than you really are. Go alone or, better yet, take two uglyfriends. I haven’t validated this trick, so goes without saying –“try it atyour own risk!” :)There is another aspect of CMT which makes it veryinteresting. If we fail to perceive the change, due to small contrast, themis-reaction may not trigger at all. For example, our kids grow up right infront of our eyes but we notice the change only when we look at old pictures.

   

  Contrast Effect and Investing

  The wholeidea behind systematic investment plan (SIP) is that a small outgo (as comparedto the whole salary) every month from our paycheque doesn’t pinch.

  As wehave seen contrast is a two sided sword, and its ill effects show up ininvesting also.

  Have youheard of “Big Bath” accounting? For the uninitiated it’s an accounting juggleryto “manage” a company’s earnings. Sometimes, to fool the shareholders, aparticular year’s poor income statement is made to look even worse byincreasing expenses and selling assets.

  As aresult, the subsequent years, especially the very next, appear much better incontrast.

  Satyam’scase is another example which shows how big accounting scams are created.

  Here iswhat Ramalinga Raju’s aides at Satyam must have told him before the scam cameto light – “If we slowly and gradually over time manipulate the numbers, theauditors won’t notice it.”

  Incidentally,in this case, even the auditors were involved! But the Satyam scam did not cometo light till Raju confessed of riding a tiger.

  You see,contrasts may blind us to change until it’s too late. For example, we oftendon’t notice the bad behaviour of others (like we ignore “small” accountingmanipulations at companies) if it goes sour gradually over time. Often we seereality as constant, although it gradually changes.

  Similarly,we fail to notice how our money disappears. It constantly loses its value, butwe do not notice because inflation happens over time. If it were imposed on usin the form of a brutal tax (and basically that’s what it is), we would beoutraged.

  Anotherarea where CMT can harm is our fixation on the stock price. When you areanalysing a business, it becomes extremely hard to overcome the temptation toignore the past stock price trends. If a stock has risen recently, oursubconscious screams that the stock has become expensive. A recent fall inprice triggers the CMT which convinces us that the stock has become cheaper.

  Myadvice? Don’t look at the stock price until you have analysed the business andworked out some valuation. For that matter, if you can’t avoid price basedscreeners, use them carefully.

  Munger:

  “Cognition, misled by tiny changes involving low contrast, willoften miss a trend that is destiny.”

  You’vejust got to acquire the skill to spot long-term trends - even if they are slow-indeed PARTICULARLY because they are slow because OTHERS who are victims of lowcontrast are going to MISS IT.

  Whatis the relationship between contrasteffect and investing? There’s a lot.

  EastmanKodak Company, commonly known as Kodak, is an American multinational imagingand photographic equipment company headquartered in New York, founded in 1880by George Eastman.

  - “You press the button, we do     the rest,” was its slogan in 1888. 
  - In 1976, it accounted for 90%     of the film and 85% of camera sales in America. 
  - In 1988, the company had     145,000 employees. 
  - Until 1990, it was regularly     rated one of the world’s five most valuable brands. 
  - In 1996, had revenue of $16     billion. 
  - In 1999, it had $2.5 billion     in profits. 
  - In 2012, revenues were $4.1     billion. Down more than 75% from 1996. If you take the effect of inflation     it was much lower. 
  - In 2012, it lost 1.3billioncomparedto1999profitsof1.3billioncomparedto1999profitsof2.5 billion. 
  - In 2012, the company filed     bankruptcy.

  Whathappened? The industry slowly shifted from film to digital photography. Kodakwas slow to adapt. Why? The margins on the film are 70 cents on a dollarcompared to 5 cents on a dollar on digital.

  Kodak wasslow to adapt to this change. Eventually it built a business on digitalcameras. What happened then? It lasted only for few years before phones withcameras came and killed it.

  Imagineyourself owing the stock of Kodak from 1990. You look at its stock price everyday. Do you think you would have spotted the bankruptcy? It was very hard! 

  Why? Whenthe business changes very slowly you are not going to spot the change if youare following it on a daily basis. The reason is because on a day-to-day basisyou will have more noise than signal. It is very hard to extract signal fromthe noise. Hence you will better off reading the annual report of the companyonce a year and forming your judgment. How many of us will do?

  Rememberwhat Charlie Munger said…

  If it comes to you in small pieces, you’re likely to miss, so ifyou’re going to be a person of good judgment, you have to do something aboutthis warp in your head where it’s so misled by mere contrast.

  Buffettin his 1998 speech sensed the troubles of Kodak…

  30 years ago, Eastman Kodak’s moat was just as wide as Coca-Cola’smoat. I mean if you were going to take a picture of your six-month old baby andyou want to look at that picture 20 years from now or 50 years from now. Andyou are never going to get a chance—you are not a professional photographer—soyou can evaluate what is going to look good 20 or 50 years ago. 

  What is in your mind about that photography company (share of mind)is what counts? Because they are promising you that the picture you take todayis going to be terrific 20 to 50 years from now about something that is veryimportant to you. Well, Kodak had that in spades 30 years ago, they owned that.They had what I call share of mind. Forget about share of market, share ofmind. They had something—that little yellow box—that said Kodak is the best.That is priceless. 

  They have lost some of that. They haven’t lost it all.

  MTNL 

  In India,one company that comes to mind is MTNL, once a leading telecom company and nowjust surviving on government’s whims.

  MTNL wasthe leading telecom services provider in Delhi and Mumbai, two of India’sleading consumers of telecom minutes then (and even now). However, even asprivate mobile telephone companies started to dent MTNL’s hegemony in these twocities, the company continued to focus on “landlines” instead of moving wheretechnology and demand were moving.

  Theresult, sales have fallen from Rs 58 billion to Rs 34 billion over 10 years,while the company is into a deep loss of Rs 52 billion as of now, compared toprofit of Rs 9 billion in 2003.

  MTNL’sfall from grace has not been drastic, but gradual. Thus, if you had been ashareholder in the company, you may not have seen the fall happening over theyears. Some of the industries I see gradually moving into the same line as MTNLare newspaper publishing, and apparel manufacturing. Watch out if you ownstocks from there!

  Movingfrom decline in businesses to decline in stocks, we often look at stock pricesnot in isolation but in contrast to where they were in the past. So a lot ofinvestors search for stocks in the 52-week low or 52-week high lists.

  While Iam not suggesting here whether these strategies are good or bad, what I amsaying is that your decision to buy or avoid a stock “today” is not dependent,in any way, on where the stock was a week, or month, or year back. Forinstance, look at these three charts of SAIL, Opto Circuits, and DeccanChronicle respectively…

  Aftereach fall, a new investor looking to invest in the stock would have beenenticed to buy thinking that the stock was “cheaper” in contrast to a week ormonth back. As for an existing investor, he would have used each fall toaverage down his cost price (a lot of people do that!). While it’s always goodto be a contrarian and buy good businesses that are out of favour and thusselling cheap, it’s dangerous to make your decision just based on that factthat “the stock is cheaper now than it was a month back!”

  Thisexample associates well with Anchoring Bias that we discussed in [Lesson 9](http://k2invest.blogspot.in/2014/12/availability-bias.html). But who said biases work inisolation? You are, in fact, affected by several of them at one time. We willstudy this in Lesson 19.

  Contrast effect in Life

  A husbandwho marries for the second time will often compare his new wife with his firstwife. That comparison is incorrect. Moreover, if the husband bases anydecisions on this comparison, it could have disastrous results on his existingmarriage.

  Oftenfound in: Decisions based on two or more alternatives.

  In Life:Munger explains how real estate agents misuse this tendency. 'A particularlyreprehensible form of sales practice occurs in the offices of some real estatebrokers. A buyer from out of the city, perhaps needing to shift his familythere, visits the office with little time available. The salesman deliberatelyshows the customer three awful houses at ridiculously high prices. Then heshows him a merely bad house at a price only moderately too high. And, boom,the broker often makes an easy sale.'

   

  Contrast Effect in Corporations

  Incorporations: The contrast- misreaction tendency is used by connivingcorporations to make the illusion that products on offer give a good deal tothe customer. This is, however, far from the truth. In a very recent example,Flipkart, one of the country's leading online retailers was found to quote aninflated MRP of `799 for a pair of wedges (sandals). The retailer subsequentlyoffered a 50 per cent discount, pricing the sandal at `399. A close inspectionof the photo reveals that the sandal has a printed MRP of `399, making theeffective discount zero. But unsuspecting customers could get away thinkingthat they got a good deal. The power of the contrast-misreaction tendency comesinto play when even after knowing of such manipulative practices, customersstill flock to buy.

   

  Contrast Effect and Big Bath Accounting

  Away companies use the contrasteffect to fool shareholders is by undertaking what isknown as “Big Bath” – an accounting jugglery that helps a company “manage” itsearnings. In simple words, bigbath is the practice of making a particular year’s poorincome statement look even worse by increasing expenses and selling assets. 

  Subsequentyears – especially the verynext – will then appear muchbetter in contrast.

  Usingbig bath, a one-time charge –or a write-off – is takenagainst income in order to reduce assets, which results in lower expenses inthe future.

  Thewrite-off removes or reduces the asset from the financial books and results inlower net income for that year. The objective is to ‘take one big bath’ in asingle year so future years, in contrast, will show increased net income.

  Thistechnique is often employed in a year when sales are down from other externalfactors and the company would report a loss in any event.

  Forexample, inventory (finished goods not sold at the end of the year) valued onthe books at Rs 100 per item is written down to Rs 50 per item resulting in anet loss of Rs 50 per item in the current year.

  Notethere is no cash impact to this write-down. When that same inventory is sold inlater years for Rs 75 per item, the company reports an income of Rs 25 per item(Rs 75 minus Rs 50) in the future period. This process takes an inventory lossand turns it into a ‘profit’.

  Companieswill often wait until a bad year to employ this ‘big bath’ technique to ‘cleanup’ the balance sheet. Although the process is discouraged by auditors, it isstill used.

  Oneexample of an Indian company using big bath accounting to show a remarkableturnaround is that of TataMotors.

  At thetime of launching ‘Indica’ in 2001-02, the company spent Rs 1,178 crore on thelaunch process. However, the company treated this as a “developmentexpenditure” that was to be spread over a number of years instead of the yearsin which it was incurred (2001-02).

  It thuswrote-off the entire amount from its “Securities Premium Account” that is shownin the Balance Sheet, and which helped it avoid showing the expense in itsProfit & Loss account.

  Thanks tothis, the company showed a net loss during 2001-02 of just Rs 53 crore ascompared to a loss of Rs 500 crore in the previous year (2000-01). If thisexpenditure of Rs 1,178 crore was shown on the P&L Account, the net lossfor 2001-02 would have been more than double of that in 2000-01.

  Ina press release, the company accepted that “…the initiative will enable the Balance Sheet to represent “better”operational results in the future years and the true shareholder value.”

  Mahindra & Mahindra, which launched“Scorpio” in 2002-03, took hints from what Tata Motors did and took a big bathon its own accounts, thereby showing a remarkable performance in that year ofScorpio’s launch, in “contrast” to the previous year.

   

   

  How Accounting Scams are Created

  “If weslowly and gradually over time manipulate the numbers, the auditors won’tnotice it.”

  This iswhat Ramalinga Raju’s aides at Satyam must have told him before the scam cameto light. Incidentally, in this case, even the auditors were involved!

  You see,contrasts may blind us to change until it’s too late. For example, we oftendon’t notice the bad behavior of others if it goes sour gradually over time.Often we see reality as constant, although it gradually changes.

  Sometimesit is the small, gradual, invisible changes that harm us the most.

  WarrenBuffett says…

  One of the problems in society is that the most important issues areoften these incremental type things. The world is not going to come to an endbecause tomorrow there are 200 or 250 thousand more people on the planet thanthere were today. That’s about the number it grows every day…it is like eatingabout 300 calories more each day than you burn up; it has no effect on youtoday. You don’t get up from the table and all of a sudden everybody says, “MyGod, you look fat compared to when you sat down!”

  But, if you keep doing it over time, the incremental problems arehard to attack because that one extra piece of pie doesn’t really seem to makea difference. The 250,000 people tomorrow don’t seem to make any difference,but the cumulative effects of them will make a huge difference over time, justlike overeating will make a huge difference over time. The time to attack thoseproblems is early.

  Unlikepeople, companies can in theory live forever. But most die young, because thecorporate world, unlike society at large, is a fight to the death.

  Thus,when we study the concept of “moats”, we will try to understand how to findcompanies that survive longer than others.

  Finally,here’s something important for your life, and investing life, that Rolf Dobelliwrites in [The Art ofThinking Clearly](http://bit.ly/13N716K)…

  When we encounter contrasts, we react like birds to a gunshot: wejump up and get moving. Our weak spot: we don’t notice small, gradual changes.A magician can make your watch vanish because, when he presses on one part ofyour body, you don’t notice the lighter touch on your wrist as he relieves youof your Rolex.

  Similarly, we fail to notice how our money disappears. It constantlyloses its value, but we do not notice because inflation happens over time. Ifit were imposed on us in the form of a brutal tax (and basically that’s what itis), we would be outraged.

  The contrasteffect can ruin your whole life: a charming womanmarries a fairly average man. But because her parents were awful people, theordinary man appears to be a prince.

  Today, wehave the technology to retouch pictures of people. So, it’s easy to “create”perfect appearances even when the reality is not so perfect…and especially whenthe reality is not so perfect.

  Beautysells, and this is most people are trying to do – either via making up their appearances or making up their financialstatements. For you, it means an extra care is needed while looking at people,things, and financial statements that look very beautiful.

  It alsomeans you are more beautiful than you think, and especially when you compareyourself to the “made-up” people out there. Now, isn’t that a self confidenceboost for you, dear friend? 

   

  Noise VS Signal

  [![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/27FEB1B9-C89A-0D49-8B91-62C679DE6879.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MFjeVpzZFKs/VoZB4CnAvwI/AAAAAAAA51c/FWBWTa0UvI8/s1600/nassim_taleb.jpg)

  The more frequently you look at data, the more noise you aredisproportionally likely to get (rather than the valuable part called thesignal); hence the higher the noise to signal ratio. And there is a confusion,that is not psychological at all, but inherent in the data itself. Say you lookat information on a yearly basis, for stock prices or the fertilizer sales ofyour father-in-law’s factory, or inﬂationnumbers in Vladivostock. Assumefurther that for what you are observing, at the yearly frequency the ratio ofsignal to noise is about one to one (say half noise, half signal) —it meansthat about half of changes are real improvements or degradations, the otherhalf comes from randomness. This ratio is what you get from yearlyobservations. But if you look at the very same data on a daily basis, thecomposition would change to 95% noise, 5% signal. And if you observe data on anhourly basis, as people immersed in the news and markets price variations do,the split becomes 99.5% noise to .5%signal. That is two hundred times morenoise than signal —which is why anyone who listens to news(except when very,very significant events take place) is one step below sucker.

  This is afantastic description of markets from Ben Graham’s Security Analysis.

  [![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/C44629AC-BAB3-784D-A10F-3823AEF66467.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GBUEd3yZraE/VodvsZaiZjI/AAAAAAAA57k/e8JqfTIYyGQ/s1600/intrinsic_value_factors_relation_to_market_price.jpg)

   Ittells you what you need to IGNORE and what you need to FOCUS on.  Thereare only a FEW things out there that are important. All the rest is NOISE.

  Grahamand Dodd then shrewdly observed that “it will be evident from the chart thatthe influence of what we call analytical factors over the market price is both partial and indirect –partial, because it frequently competes with purely speculative factors whichinfluence the price in the opposite direction; and indirect, because it actsthrough the intermediary of people’s sentiments and decisions.

   

  Contrast, the Invisible Killer

  Contrastsmakes us blind to slow change until it’s too late. The reality around us seemspretty much constant, although it’s continuously changing. The change in astimulus has to cross a certain threshold before our awareness can register it.

  It’sworth mentioning here a tremendously useful mental model from Charlie Munger’sLatticework called boiling frog syndrome, described by Prof Bakshi in thiswonderful [blog post](http://goo.gl/RjsuQP). He explains –

  Small incremental changes tend to go unnoticed…If you put a frog inhot boiling water, he will instantly leap out of the pan and be never seenagain. But, if you put a frog in a pan with room temperature water and slowlyturn up the heat, he wouldn’t be able to tell the tiny incremental changes. Hewill boil and die.

  [![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/A87993F7-3AD1-1F48-A361-78C0B49BD0D8.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GnVQCURzmBs/VnJXgF5lEFI/AAAAAAAA4vw/SvD-rsHFOuA/s1600/frog_in_boiling_water_syndrome.png)

  CharlieMunger once said that many businesses die just like the boiling frog.Cognition, misled by tiny changes involving low contrast, will often miss atrend that is destiny. He further warns – 

  When a man’s steps are consecutively taken toward disaster with eachstep being very small, the brain’s Contrast-Misreaction Tendency will often letthe man go too far toward disaster to be able to avoid it. This happens becauseeach step presents so small a contrast from his present position.

  To asmall stimulus, only a small amount must be added. To a larger stimulus, alarge amount must be added.

  WarrenBuffett says –

  One of the problems in society is that the most important issues areoften these incremental type things…But, if you keep doing it over time, theincremental problems are hard to attack because that one extra piece of piedoesn’t really seem to make a difference…but the cumulative effects of themwill make a huge difference over time, just like overeating will make a hugedifference over time. The time to attack those problems is early.

  Sometimesit is the small, gradual, invisible changes that harm us the most.

   

  Conclusion

  Understandthat CMT is everywhere, and that we view our world through its lens – rose coloured or otherwise.

  Fewpsychological tendencies do more damage to correct thinking than CMT. WarrenBuffett was probably referring to contrast bias when he said –

  Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy tobe broken.

  It’sinteresting that most bad habits are formed because of this tendency butfortunately this bias, if used intelligently, can help us form good habits too.John Wooden, one of the most successful coaches in the history of basketball,observed –

  When you improve a little each day, eventually big things occur …Don’t look for big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at atime. That’s the only way it happens and when it happens, it lasts.

  I wantedto tell my friend, Mr. Irrational, that he was taken for a ride by his tailorsbut then I thought to myself, “Let me keep the poor kid happy.” After all hestill believes that he stole a great deal.

  But youdon’t forget to include CMT in your mental model checklist. And at the sametime don’t forget to make use of it for creating good habits.

  Take careand keep learning.
