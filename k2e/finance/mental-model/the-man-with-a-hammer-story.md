Don’t tryto explain things by thinking of one reason and then latching on to it. Bigoutcomes are rarely caused because of one reason. Ask “what else can cause thisoutcome.” In the Milgram experiment people gave what they thought were electricshocks to innocent strangers. What caused that? Was it authority bias alone?What were the other models at work?

Don’tsolve problems with the only tool you possess. Get more tools. Make achecklist.

 

FromJanav: 

Inever understood the essence of this statement for a very long time. Few yearsback, I came across Charlie Munger’s writing on [Elementary WorldlyWisdom](http://ycombinator.com/munger.html) that explained the meaning clearly.

What are the models? Well, the first rule is that you’ve got to havemultiple models—because if you just have one or two that you’re using, thenature of human psychology is such that you’ll torture reality so that it fits your models, or at least you’ll think it does. You become the equivalent of achiropractor who, of course, is the great boob in medicine.

What causes man with a hammer syndrome?

It’s like the old saying, “To the man with only a hammer, everyproblem looks like a nail.” And of course, that’s the way the chiropractor goesabout practicing medicine. But that’s a perfectly disastrous way to think and aperfectly disastrous way to operate in the world. So you’ve got to havemultiple models. And the models have to come from multipledisciplines—because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in onelittle academic department. That’s why poetry professors, by and large, are sounwise in a worldly sense. They don’t have enough models in their heads. Soyou’ve got to have models across a fair array of disciplines.

Efficient Market Theory

EfficientMarket Theory(EMT) states that

1. Market is     always efficient.
2. No investment strategy would     be better than a coin toss.
3. It is not possible for an     investor to beat the market.

IfEMT were true then how do we explain these [results](http://www7.gsb.columbia.edu/alumni/news/hermes/print-archive/superinvestors)?

What made these economists love the efficient markettheory?

Mungerexplains it in ‘[Psychology of Human Misjudgment](http://www.rbcpa.com/Mungerspeech_june_95.pdf)‘

And after all, math was what they’d learned to do. To the man with ahammer, every  problem tends to look pretty much like a nail. Thealternative truth was a little messy, and  they’d forgotten the greateconomists Keynes, whom I think said, “Better to be roughly right thanprecisely wrong.

EMT had agreat influence on me and I am a firm believer of index investing. There isnothing wrong in that. But I never even tried investingin individual stocks, which is bad. After reading Munger’s writing Ihave changed. One of the economists who won the Nobel prize for his work on EMTexplained Berkshire’s success in the following way.

In fact one of the economists who won — he shared a Nobel Prize — and as he looked at Berkshire Hathawayyear after year, which people would throw in his face as saying maybe themarket isn’t quite as efficient as you think, he said, “Well, it’s a two-sigmaevent.” And then he said we were a three-sigma event. And then he said wewere a four-sigma event. And he finally got up to six sigmas — better to add asigma than change a theory, just because the evidence comes in differently.And, of course, when this share of a Nobel Prize went into money managementhimself, he sank like a stone.

How do we not have man with a hammer syndrome?

Accordingto Munger, we have to “jump jurisdictional boundaries” and grab the mostappropriate models from multiple disciplines that best solve the problem athand. Sanjay Bakshi, professor whose writing helped  me to learn a lotexplains about ‘[Are CFOs Men With Hammers](http://fundooprofessor.blogspot.com/2006/11/are-cfos-men-with-hammers.html)‘

Man with hammer in my profession

I workedin Oracle for few years and developed HR Applications. All the business logicwere written in PL/SQL. There is nothing wrong in that. My view of software gotchanged and I tried solving all the problems using the database. After leavingOracle I developed a search application and I used a 7 table join to render thesearch results. What is the issue with the approach? This will not scale.During that time open source software like Apache Lucene was available and Inever bothered to learn and use it. What I had was Man with a hammer syndrome.

Over thelast few years the demand for Full stack web developer is very high.People with these skills can do frontend and backend software development.Sometimes I wonder is this really hard? Should this not be the norm? May be thesoftware industry is embracing specialization like Adam Smith – Pin Factoryor is this man with the hammer syndrome?

Inthe book [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X) the authors defines the pragmatic programmer as

Pragmatic Programmers are not wedded to a particular methodology,language, operating system, notation, whatever. Instead, they use theirexperience, combined with research, to choose the most appropriate combinationsof tools for the job at hand. Pragmatic Programmers are not hammer wielders insearch of nails.

But whatis the reality?

These people are in the minority!
