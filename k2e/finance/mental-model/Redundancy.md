This article is the seventh of this weeklyseries called [Latticework of Mental Models](http://www.safalniveshak.com/category/mental-models/), which will be authored by my friend andpartner in writing the [Value Investing Almanack](http://almanack.safalniveshak.com/), Anshul Khare. Anshul will write onvarious mental models – big ideas from various disciplines – which can help youthink more rationally while analyzing businesses and making your stockinvestment decisions.

 

 

What’syour favourite day or time of the week? For somebody like me with aMonday-Friday job, the favourite part of the week usually is Saturdaymorning. Now, what could be the best way to ruin a Saturday morning? Let metell how I (almost) achieved the feat.

On a cooland breezy weekend morning when most people prefer to sit in the balcony andsip on a hot beverage, I was standing just outside my front door with milkpacket in hand and toothbrush in my mouth, wondering why do they build theseauto-lock doors.

Yes, youguessed it right. I managed to lock myself out of my house. Everythingincluding my keys, glasses, cell phone, wallet, and slippers were behind thedoor which was slammed shut by the very same saturday morning breeze.

Howeverthe story had a happy ending when I was rescued by my saviour. Saviour? Yes andit was none other than our mental model for today – Mr. Red (short for Redundancy).

FortunatelyI had kept a spare key with my trustworthy friend living few blocks away. Iquickly ran to his house, got my spare key and thanked Mr. Red.

Althoughit did raise few eyebrows among the neighbours when they saw a guy withdisheveled hair, scurrying across the street barefoot with a milk packet inhand and toothbrush sticking out from mouth. Forgive me for being little toodramatic here but please stay with this post for a little longer to know moreabout the insightful personality of Mr. Red.

I knowthat sharing a spare key isn’t a novel idea. People do it all the time but ithighlights the significance of building redundancy in our day to day affairs.If redundancy is so important in such small matters, imagine its utility inother critical matters. That’s what we are going to explore today. So let’sstart with a working definition.

Redundancy is defined as the existence of morethan one means for accomplishing a given task. To be more specific, redundancyrefers to the process of adding ‘extra’ instances of critical components to asystem so that one can take over for another if something breaks. Thus all ofthese ‘instances’ must fail before there is a system failure.

Lookaround you. Spare tyre in your vehicle, power backup generator sets in yourapartment, fire exits in your office building, etc., are all typical examplesof redundancy designs.

To anuntrained eye, redundancy may seem ambiguous because it looks like a waste ofresources if nothing unusual happens. Except that the complexity of modernworld ensures that the unusual would happen quite frequently and unexpectedly.

Have youever keenly observed the nature? It’s the best place to learn about redundancy.

Redundancy in Nature

Ifyou look at the mother nature it’s easy to see that redundancy is everywhere.Nassim Taleb writes in [Fooled by Randomness](http://amzn.to/13qx7wi) –

Mother Nature likes redundancies…the simplest to understand, isdefensive redundancy, the insurance type of redundancy that allows you tosurvive under adversity, thanks to the availability of spare parts. Look at thehuman body. We have two eyes, two lungs, two kidneys, even two brains – andeach has more capacity than needed in ordinary circumstances.

So redundancy equals insurance, and the apparent inefficiencies areassociated with the costs of maintaining these spare parts and the energyneeded to keep them around in spite of their idleness….Layers of redundancy arethe central risk management property of natural systems.

A lot ofspecies in animal kingdom give birth to multiple offsprings (it’s common forsome insects and fishes to lay millions of eggs in a single season) to ensurethat at least some of them survive and carry forward the gene. Isn’t thatredundancy? Nature likes to over-insure itself.

As anaside to the central argument of redundancy, it’s worth mentioning aninteresting insight which comes from Bill Gates. One of the focus areas for hisphilanthropic initiatives is to improve the child survival rates in poorAfrican countries. For many naive armchair philosophers, it seems counterintuitive because logic says that instead of focusing on saving newborns, weshould educate the poor women to have fewer kids since it’s common in thesecountries for families to have 3-4 children. Moreover saving children willeventually lead to a bigger population in future which in turn will worsen theliving conditions further. Right? Wrong!

Look atthis situation from the lens of redundancy mental model. One of the reasonspeople (and this could be a subconscious drive instilled by nature) havemultiple children is – they assume some of those children aren’t going tosurvive to adulthood because of poor health care facilities. However Mr. Gates’argument is that the moment you improve the survival rate for children, peoplewon’t feel the need to have multiple children. So, over the long term, you endup eliminating the root cause of population growth. It’s a brilliant insight.

Let’s nowshift gears a bit and turn to the field of engineering.

Redundancy in Engineering

We sawredundancy in nature is quite common but this mental model can be formallycategorised as a big idea from the field of Engineering.

In fact,when it comes to software engineering, building backup and additional redundantcapacity is at the heart of architecting software systems. Large softwareenterprises (including Facebook, Google, Twitter, and all the banks) go as faras having multiple data centers spread across continents to ensure that evenlarge scale catastrophic events don’t cause irrecoverable damage.

Most ofthe commercial airliners have multiple engines so in case of failure of even asingle engine, the flight can continue with spare engines. And not just theengine, most of the critical parts in an airplane have redundancy of some formor other.

In fact,while designing critical systems, it doesn’t suffice to build redundancy basedon the historical worst case scenario. You actually have to overcompensate.Because the so-called worst-case event, when it happened, exceeded the worstcase at that time. Nassim Taleb has named this inconsistency as “The LucretiusProblem”.

Redundancy in Investing

Thegreat Chinese philosopher Confucius said –

The superior man, when resting in safety, does not forget thatdanger may come. When in a state of security he does not forget the possibilityof ruin. When all is orderly, he does not forget that disorder may come. Thushis person is not endangered, and his States and all their clans are preserved.

Oneof first things advised for personal finance is to create an [emergency fund](http://www.safalniveshak.com/become-your-own-financial-planner/) for yourself. This fundshould cover 6 to 8 months of your expenses and it should be kept ultra safei.e., either in FDs or liquid funds. That’s creating redundancy for securingthe future of your family. Getting adequate medical and life cover adds additionalredundancy.

Thefather of value investing, Benjamin Graham, pioneered the concept of margin of safetywhich is nothing but building redundancy in your investment portfolio. WarrenBuffett, in his 1993 letter to investors, says –

We insist on a margin of safety in our purchase price. If wecalculate the value of a common stock to be only slightly higher than itsprice, we’re not interested in buying. We believe this margin-of-safetyprinciple, so strongly emphasized by Ben Graham, to be the cornerstone ofinvestment success.

In fact,having redundant cash in your investment kitty isn’t merely a defensivestrategy. Come a market crash and your defensive strategy opportunisticallyturns into an aggressive strategy. It’s more like an investment rather thaninsurance.

For thatmatter, debt is the inverse of redundancy. It not only takes away the safety,it actually makes your finances extremely fragile in the face of unexpectedadversity.

Where It Fails

Before webecome too obsessed with the idea of redundancy, it’s important to understandits limitations, lest we become the proverbial man with the hammer to whomevery problem looked like a nail.

Canredundancy backfire? Shane Parrish, in his blog Farnam Street, explains itwonderfully –

First, in certain cases, the added benefits of redundancy areoutweighed by the risks of added complexity. Since adding redundancy increasesthe complexity of a system, efforts to increase reliability and safety throughredundant systems may backfire and inadvertently make systems more susceptibleto failure. An example of how adding complexity to a system can increase theodds of failure can be found in the near-meltdown of the Femi reactor in 1996.This incident was caused by an emergency safety device which broke off andblocked a pipe stopping the flow of coolants into the reactor core. Luckilythis was before the plant was active.

Second, redundancy with people can lead to social diffusion wherepeople always assume it was someone else who had the responsibility.

Anotherway in which redundancy can cause damage is when it makes people overconfident.How?

Youmust have heard this joke floating around on the Internet – You don’t need a parachute for skydiving.You need it for trying skydiving more than once. 

![:-)](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/64601D5E-EAA0-B245-9DDE-CEF479BFBC1F.png)

Everyskydiver jumps with a reserve parachute. What if even the second doesn’t openup? Well…so much for skydiving! Irony is that presence of a backup promotes theskydivers to attempt even riskier maneuvers which defeats the purpose of havingadditional safety.

Similarly,as the automobiles become safer, drivers go faster and take on more risks. Samein case of sports too. The recent tragic demise of an Australian cricketer PhilHughes can probably be attributed to the same reason.

Facing express bowlers of the past, whether Harold Larwood, AndyRoberts or Malcolm Marshall, helmet-less batsmen were less inclined to play thehook—a shot that involves swatting a short-pitched ball from in front of yournose—because of the danger of getting it wrong. They were also more likely tokeep their eye on a threatening ball and sway out of the way at the lastmoment, as the coaching manual demands. Today, with greater protection, thereseems to be more of a propensity for batsmen to flinch and turn their backs onanything nasty… those with exposed heads were more likely to play back-footshots, which give batsmen extra time to follow the flight of the ball.

So do yousee the paradox of redundancy?

Nonethelessit’s an important mental model and extremely useful one in designing systemsaround us.

Conclusion

If youthought that after that fateful Saturday morning, I would have learnt mylesson, then you are underestimating me. I repeated the same blunder but thistime with my car and as usual Mr. Red saved me again.

I guessit should be obvious to you by now that creating redundancy doesn’t meanavoiding the worst case scenario, but it assumes that the worst case willhappen time to time and then making arrangements to minimize the harm.

So pleasedon’t forget to make friends with Mr. Red.

Nowthat we have learned some [mentalmodels](http://www.safalniveshak.com/category/mental-models/) in past few weeks, the next questions iswhat to do with them? Shane of Farnam Street again answers this questionbeautifully –

After we learn a model we have to make it useful. We have tointegrate it into our existing knowledge. Our world is multidimensional and ourproblems are complicated. Most problems cannot be solved using one model alone.The more models we have the better able we are to rationally solve problems.But if we don’t have the models we become the proverbial man with a hammer. Tothe man with a hammer everything looks like a nail. If you only have one modelyou will fit whatever problem you face to the model you have. If you have morethan one model, however, you can look at the problem from a variety ofperspectives and increase the odds you come to a better solution.

As alwaysI would urge you to become a proactive learner. Reading educates, but when youput your own independent thinking to what you learn, it makes the lesson lastlonger. So I invite you to take a pause for few minutes and think about yourown experiences and observations where these mental models might fit in.

If youcan share them in Comments section of this post, others (including me) wouldbenefit from your thinking and of course just the act of writing will unleashinteresting insights in your own head.

So whatare you waiting for? Lose the mouse, grab the keyboard and start typing.

It is mysincere hope that the latticework series will enrich your world by making it amore profitable and enjoyable place to invest, work, and live.

Take careand keep learning.
