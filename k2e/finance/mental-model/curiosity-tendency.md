What isit? This is the tendency to remain curious of one's surroundings. The curiositytendency is indeed a curious entry in Munger's list of tendencies. You maywonder why. Because it apparently is a positive tendency. Says Munger,'Curiosity, enhanced by the best of modern education (which is by definition aminority part in many places), much helps man to prevent or reduce badconsequences arising from other psychological tendencies.'

Do notunderestimate the power of curiosity. Many inventions and accidentaldiscoveries have been found to have begun as curiosities. This behaviour is anancient practice that old civilisations benefitted from. Says Munger, 'Athens(including its colony, Alexandria) developed much math and science out of purecuriosity while the Romans made almost no contribution to either math orscience. They instead concentrated their attention on the 'practical'engineering of mines, roads, aqueducts, etc.'

Oftenfound in: Sources of learning, inventions and discoveries

In Life:Curiosity is often the basis of learning. Without curiosity, one cannot developthe desire to learn. And with continuous learning comes great payoffs. SaysMunger, 'The curious are also provided with much fun and wisdom once formaleducation has ended.'

Incorporations: The lack of curiosity in corporations can often result indisastrous results. Companies need to keep an open mind about how changes inenvironment could affect operations.

InInvesting: Rather than looking out for the next hot stock, researching a stockwith a curious mind is likely to produce better results. You won't bevulnerable to any bad tips or stocks that your broker tells you.
