What isit? The flip side of the liking/loving tendency, this tendency causes us toignore the virtues of people or things that we hate or dislike and can oftenlead to distortion of facts to perpetuate that hatred.

The disliking/hating tendency is an ancient behaviour, says Munger.'The long history of man contains almost continuous war. For instance, mostAmerican Indian tribes warred incessantly, and some tribes would occasionallybring captives home to women so that all could join in the fun of torturingcaptives to death. Even with the spread of religion and the advent of advancedcivilization, much modern war remains pretty savage.'

Just howstrong a hold hatred can take over our lives is visible from the continuedgrudge a person can hold against another long after he may have forgotten whatthe original feud was about. This 'hating-to-the-guts' tendency is programmedinto human behaviour. Munger notes, 'The dislikings and hatreds never go awaycompletely. Born into man, these driving tendencies remain strong. Thus, we getmaxims like the one from England: 'Politics is the art of marshalling hatreds'.And we also get the extreme popularity of very negative political advertisingin the United States.'

Oftenfound in: Nearly everyone

 

Impact of hating/disliking 

In Life 

In Life:Who among us has not seen family feuds? Now you can pinpoint the culprit - thedisliking/hating tendency. 'At the family level, we often see one sibling hatehis other siblings and litigate with them endlessly if he can afford it.Indeed, a wag named Buffett has repeatedly explained to me that a majordifference between rich and poor people is that the rich people can spend theirlives suing their relatives.'

Thedisliking/hating tendency sneaks up on the hater, who starts behaving in thefollowing manner: '(1) ignore virtues in the object of dislike, (2) dislikepeople, products, and actions merely associated with the object of his dislike,and (3) distort other facts to facilitate hatred.

Distortionof that kind is often so extreme that miscognition is shockingly large. Whenthe World Trade Center was destroyed, many Pakistanis immediately concludedthat the Hindus did it, while many Muslims concluded that the Jews did it. Suchfactual distortions often make mediation between opponents locked in hatredeither difficult or impossible. Mediations between Israelis and Palestiniansare difficult because facts in one side's history overlap very little withfacts from the other side's.'

 

In Corporations 

Incorporations: The disliking/ hating tendency can play havoc with investors'money if the business is family-run and is caught up in a family feud. Considerthe cases of BPL, Mafatlal and Bajaj. For an excellent discussion on familyfeuds wrecking Indian businesses, read the excellent book Business Battles:Family Feuds That Changed Indian Industry by Shyamal Majumdar.

 

In Investing 

InInvesting: The disliking/hating tendency interferes with clear thinking. Manyinvestors who bought into the Infosys story at the peak of the technology bullrun did not see their investments recover in the six years following the techcrash of 2000. It didn't matter that they could buy the same stock at 75 percent discount from its lifetime peak for many years after the tech meltdown.Anyone who would have invested in the stock as late as 2003 would now besitting on a 10x multi-bagger.
