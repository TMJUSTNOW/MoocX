From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history):

The [Collins English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_English_Dictionary) definesalternative history as "a genre of fiction in which the author speculateson how the course of history might have been altered if a particular historicalevent had had a different outcome."[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history#cite_note-5)According to [Steven H Silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_H_Silver), an American sciencefiction editor, alternate history requires three things: a [pointof divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_divergence) from the history of our world priorto the time at which the author is writing; a change that would alter historyas it is known; and an examination of the ramifications of that change.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history#cite_note-SHS-6)

 

Let me make an offer to you which has apotential to make you richer by couple of million dollars and that requires aneffort not more than wiggling a finger. Would you be interested?

“What’s the catch?” That would be your firstquestion, right?

Well, I’ll leave it to you tofigure out the catch. So here is the deal, in fact I’ll let Nassim Taleb,author of [Fooled By Randomness](http://safalniveshak.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dfffd9e0dc3c1e2bec89cab7a&id=85477d110f&e=1a99b5f8c8), do the explaining –

Imagine you are offered $10 millionto play Russian roulette, i.e., to put a revolver containing one bullet in thesix available chambers to your head and pull the trigger[no effort, I toldyou!]. Each realisation would count as one history, for a total of six possiblehistories of equal probabilities. Five out of these six histories would lead toenrichment; one would lead to a statistic, that is, an obituary with anembarrassing (but certainly original) cause of death.

Although,Russian roulette is a hypothetical situation, a thought experiment, but ithighlights a big flaw that exists in how we perceive the reality. Taleb adds – 

The problem is that only one of thehistories is observed in reality; and the winner of $10 million would elicitthe admiration and praise…the public observes the external signs of wealthwithout even having a glimpse at the source.

So can you see how we are blind toalternative histories? The silent events i.e., the events which could havehappened but didn’t. In the language of behavioural finance this irrationalityis known as Survivorship Bias. The outcome which is visible, ‘survived’ and the ones which didn’tsurvive are hidden.

In effect, the general belief is that if theoutcome is good, the process and decisions made to arrive at that outcome musthave been sound.

Alas, life doesn’t follow such straightpatterns. The randomness and ‘external factors’ play a defining role in lifeand, as we will see later in this post, in investing too. Taleb notes –

Reality is far more vicious thanRussian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, likea revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands, of chambers instead ofsix. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet,under numbing false sense of security…

…one is thus capable of unwittinglyplaying Russian roulette and calling it by some alternative “low risk” name. Wesee the wealth being generated…people lose sight of their risks. The game seemsterribly easy and we play along carelessly.

What are these Russian roulette(ish) games inreal life, you may ask. Using debt to buy things (especially the things thatyou don’t need) is one such game. Buying stocks on debt or on margin isanother.

And then comes along somebody who warnsinvestors not to play this simple looking (but risky) game, but his advice isignored.

Say you engage in a business of protectinginvestors from rare events and say nothing happens during the period. Some ofthem will complain, “You wasted my money on insurance last year, the factorydidn’t burn, it was a stupid expense. You should only insure for events thathappen.”

Another unintended outcome of alternativehistory blindness is that we grow confident about our understanding of thegame. We rationalize the causal link between the event and the associatedoutcome (also known as NarrativeFallacy or Hindsight Bias). Our thinking becomesoutcome-centric.

In a wonderful book [Everything is Obvious](http://safalniveshak.us2.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=dfffd9e0dc3c1e2bec89cab7a&id=fb66eaf1c4&e=1a99b5f8c8), the author, Duncan J. Watts writes –

In a variety of lab experiments,psychologists have asked participants to make predictions about future eventsand then reinterviewed them after the events in question had taken place. Whenrecalling their previous predictions, subjects consistently report being morecertain of their correct predictions, and less certain of their incorrectpredictions, than they had reported at the time they made them.

An interesting experiment (youmust read [this](http://safalniveshak.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dfffd9e0dc3c1e2bec89cab7a&id=df309d89a8&e=1a99b5f8c8)) was designed to simulate parallel worlds and the results of thisexperiment proved that the role of randomness in success is bigger than weusually imagine.

Does it mean that we should ignore the past andstop making plans for the future? Of course not! It just means that we shouldhave a healthy skepticism towards predictions and explanations that are servedto us by others (including the ones served by our own lizard-brain).

You should first focus on the path/process thatwas followed to achieve the outcome. A good process ensures a good outcome overlong term. The following matrix is helpful in understanding the importance of‘good process’ in decision making.

 

Failing of Startups

[[m](https://medium.com/mikes-mental-models/02-alternative-histories-4a494f0e9da2#.flx3zarbe)]Today’s model is alternative histories, the idea that realized outcomes are a blip on the spectrum ofoutcomes.

Isaw this when writing [28Lessons from Start-ups that Failed](http://amzn.to/1nztynB). Many of thosefounders were mindful of the difficulty, but didn’t think about the range ofoutcomes. Relationships were destroyed, bank accounts emptied, and livesrevised. Their spectrum of outcomes was; failure, failure, failure, failure,failure, success, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure,failure, etc.

However,the alternative histories of failed start-ups included personal growth. Many ofthe failed founders noted that the experience was like their version ofgraduate school. They learned new skills and met people they otherwise neverwould have known. They may have lost money, but, they were young enough, itwasn’t a big deal.

 

Going on Vacation

Alternativehistory as a mental model is one where we consider the spectrum of outcomesbefore our decision.

In[Fooled by Randomness](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812975219/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0812975219&linkCode=as2&tag=miksblo09-20&linkId=7UJDRTSMHONTKHW4), Nassim Talebwrites why this model works:

“I start with the platitude that one cannot judge a performance inany given field by the results, but by the costs of the alternative. Suchsubstitute courses of events are called alternatives histories. Clearly, thequality of a decision cannot be solely judged based on its outcome, but such apoint seems to be voiced only by people who fail.”

In thebook, Taleb compares the lifetime earnings of dentists and janitors (one whomwins the lottery). We will think about vacations.

Goingto Disney — like a dentist’s career — has little variance. Parents know thatDisney will be expensive, crowded, and manufactured, but also that it will besafe, geared toward kids, and clearly marked off the freeway. Disney has anormal distribution.

Normaldistribution, true for dentists and disney.

Comparethis to a family vacation in Maine. Now you need to figure out what to do, howto get there, and where to stay. You’ll certainly try a lobster roll, but willyour kids? Maine is beautiful, but how much can kids hike or row before theyget tired. Once they tire, you’ll get back in the car (for at least an hour ofwinding road driving) and they’ll ask ‘are we there yet?’ Maine has highervariance than Disney. It could be a lot better, but also, worse.

Inthese vacation assumptions we can also see the importance of our startingplace. Latchkey kids might enjoy Disney. Homeschool kids prefer Maine. Bothfamilies though can use the alternative history model.

 

In Investing

As Taleb writes in his book –

…in time, if the roulette-bettingfool keeps playing the game, the bad histories will tend to catch up with him.Thus, if a twenty-five-year-old played Russian roulette, say, once a year,there would be a very slim possibility of him surviving until his fiftiethbirthday – but, if there are enough players, say thousands oftwenty-five-year-old players, we can expect to see a handful of (extremelyrich) survivors (and a very large cemetery).

If you draw a parallel to this in thestock market, in a field populated by thousands of traders, speculators, andpeople buying stocks on leverage, at the end of a say 10-15 years, you maystill find a very few lucky survivors, but there will also be a very largecemetery (of those who destroyed wealth using the same routes).

Sometimes, people are indeed aware of the risksinherent in Russian roulette kind of investing, and they still do it. However,the quality of money earned this way (a stressful process) is not the same asthe one earned by non-fatal means like sensible, patient, long-term investingwithout borrowing other people’s money (stress-free process).

Of course, in the end, you may earn a similaramount of money either ways – through day trading, speculation, and leverage ORpatient, long-term investing – but the former’s dependence on randomness isgreater than the latter’s.

To the accountant, they would be identical; toyour next door neighbour too. Yet, deep down, you know that they arequalitatively different.

As an investor, you may want tominimize the heart-wrenching rides that you may experience during the course ofinvesting period. This is how Prof. Sanjay Bakshi concluded in his article on “[Return per unit of stress](http://safalniveshak.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dfffd9e0dc3c1e2bec89cab7a&id=17262abb9b&e=1a99b5f8c8)” –

“My advice to those who ignore the stress partof the equation but focus only on returns per unit of risk: You cannot take itaway with you, so what’s the point of all that stress, just for the money?”

The legendary Howard Marks wrote this in one ofhis memos to shareholders in 2006…

In the investing world, one can livefor years off one great coup or one extreme but eventually accurate forecast.But what’s proved by one success? When markets are booming, the best resultsoften go to those who take the most risk. Were they smart to anticipate goodtimes and bulk up on beta, or just congenitally aggressive types who werebailed out by events? Most simply put, how often in our business are peopleright for the wrong reason?

The people Marks is referring to are the onesTaleb calls “lucky idiots,” and in the short run it’s certainly hard todifferential between them and skilled investors.

Here is what Marks wrote in a 2002 memo…

I find that I agree with essentiallyall of Taleb’s important points.

- Investors are right (and     wrong) all the time for the “wrong reason.” Someone buys a stock because     he or she expects a certain development; it doesn’t occur; the market     takes the stock up anyway; the investor looks good (and invariably accepts     credit).
- The correctness of a decision     can’t be judged from the outcome. Nevertheless, that’s how people assess     it. A good decision is one that’s optimal at the time it’s made, when the     future is by definition unknown. Thus, correct decisions are often     unsuccessful, and vice versa.
- Randomness alone can produce     just about any outcome in the short run. In portfolios that are allowed to     reflect them fully, market movements can easily swamp the skillfulness of     the manager (or lack thereof). But certainly market movements cannot be     credited to the manager (unless he or she is the rare market timer who’s     capable of getting it right repeatedly).
- For these reasons, investors     often receive credit they don’t deserve. One good coup can be enough to     build a reputation, but clearly a coup can arise out of randomness alone.     Few of these “geniuses” are right more than once or twice in a row.
- Thus, it’s     essential to have a large number of observations – lots of years of     data – before judging a     given manager’s ability.

Invert, Always Invert!

Although Survivorship Bias is a serious cognitive bias and leads toerroneous decision making, I believe it can be used for our benefit also. Usingthe [idea of inversion](http://safalniveshak.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dfffd9e0dc3c1e2bec89cab7a&id=bd16d05b49&e=1a99b5f8c8), let me make an attempt to find a useful way toexploit this bias.

It’s actually a nice little hack related to theconcept of alternative history. I frequently use this imagination trick toincrease the quality of my day to day life.

Right now I am sitting on a comfortable chair,writing on my laptop while sipping an organic tea. But there is anotherpossible path that history could have taken. In that alternative path, Iimagine being born in a poor African country where (forget internet or evenelectricity) one has to walk 5 miles every day to fetch drinking water.

Thinking about this alternative history forcesmy mind to be grateful for all the blessings that are present in my life rightnow. After all alternative histories aren’t just about Russian roulettes andinvesting.

 

Misc

In[episode#01 we talked about Fabian knots and Chesterton fences](https://medium.com/mikes-mental-models) and noted that we can look at the history of something to see whyit exists and then act. For alternative histories we need less focus, and moreperipheral vision. We need to think horizontal, not vertical.

Inalternative histories we need to consider the scope of outcomes — and oftenseek outside sources of information. We have limited circuitry. We have biases.Here are a few examples to get you started:

- Charles     Lindbergh was one of many pilots queuing in New York City to attempt a     trans-Atlantic crossing. The odds may have been stacked aways him, but not     on the whole. The situation was ripe for someone. Lindbergh was one of     many pilots that had the right set of skills, circumstances, and luck. This is a case of alternative histories being narrow, it was     going to happen.
- A century     earlier France had a much wider range of outcomes. It’s not clear that     France would have marched to war if there hadn’t been a Napoleon. The     French Revolution was fertile ground for something, but thorny Napoleon     was only one of many possible histories. This is a case     of alternative histories being wide, it was an outlier.
- In Full House,     Stephen Jay Gould asks why the horse we know today is the only horse we     know. Why are there 4 species of zebra, 5 species of wild ass, but only 2     species of horses? Gould suggests that observed outcomes are not better,     but path dependent. This is a case of alternative     histories being path dependent, as they say in the movies, there’s no     turning back.
- In [Zero to One](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804139296/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0804139296&linkCode=as2&tag=miksblo09-20&linkId=YS57LNSI27VLI7CG), Peter Thiel     writes about technology but also his career. Thiel interviewed for a     clerkship with the Supreme Court, but wasn’t hired. “With the benefit of     hindsight,” Thiel writes, “we know that winning that ultimate competition     would have changed my life for the worse.” Would it? My guess is that he     would have succeeded anywhere. This is a case of     alternative history observations being biased.

Theseanecdotes are more memorable than applicable. Hopefully they jumpstart your useof this mental model. Our founding mental model advocate, Charlie Munger spokeabout how to use alternative histories rigorously. Apply a little algebra — andour anecdotes become decision tree theory. About this Munger says:

“So you have to learn in a very usable way this very elementary mathand use it routinely in life…If you don’t get this elementary, but mildlyunnatural, mathematics of elementary probability into your repertoire, then yougo through a long life like a onel egged man in an asskicking contest. You’regiving a huge advantage to everybody else. One of the advantages of a fellowlike Buffett, whom I’ve worked with all these years, is that he automaticallythinks in terms of decision trees and the elementary math of permutations andcombinations

Youhave to know that the outcome was only a outcome. Consider the other histories that you don’t observeplaying out and then you’ll get a true picture of the payout. Alternativehistories get us past biases and to see the world more clearly.

 

Iapplied this just last week when I wrote [notes about Sam Hinkie’sresignation letter](http://gum.co/hinkieletter).

 

Conclusion

Warren Buffett’s appendix to thefourth revised edition of [The Intelligent Investor](http://safalniveshak.us2.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=dfffd9e0dc3c1e2bec89cab7a&id=e1c1f09961&e=1a99b5f8c8) describes a contest in which each of the 225million Americans starts with $1 and flips a coin once a day. The people whoget it right on day one collect a dollar from those who were wrong and go on toflip again on day two, and so forth. Ten days later, 220,000 people have calledit right ten times in a row and won $1,000.

Buffett writes, “They may try to be modest, butat cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of theopposite sex what their technique is, and what marvellous insights they bringto the field of flipping.”

After another ten days, we’re down to 215survivors who’ve been right 20 times in a row and have each won $1 million.They write books titled How ITurned a Dollar into a Million in Twenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning and sell tickets to seminars.

“Worse yet,” Buffett writes, “they’ll probablystart jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coin-flippingand tackling skeptical professors with, “If it can’t be done, why are there 215of us?”

If you don’t know how to separate a goodprocess from a bad one, you’ll surely fall for these ‘efficient coin-flipping’wizards.

Learn to focus on the process more than theoutcome. Use common sense and your own thinking to filter out theoutcome-centric hindsight-heavy theories.

Take care and keep learning.
