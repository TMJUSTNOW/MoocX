Thedictionary definition of 'twaddle' is silly idle talk, something that isinsignificant or worthless. Humans have a tendency to engage in twaddle ormeaningless activities that don't amount to much.

 

Financial News Channels

Open anyfinancial news channel and often you can find a so called expert beinginterviewed on his opinion about the direction of the stock market and healthof the economy.

Onbeing asked such macro questions, the answer usually goes something like this –

Maybe thegentleman above has a point. But I just don’t see it. Do you? All I see is thathis verbal diarrhea was completely useless.

Inmost cases, the right (and honest) answer is  – I don’t know.

Buthow can experts not know? They are interviewed because they’re supposed to know abouteverything. And even if they don’t know, what is Google for? All the facts andfigures are few key strokes away, so it’s a sin to not have an opinionabout everything, especially if you’re considered an expert and probably beingcompensated by pay per word.

 

So doesit mean you are entitled to have an opinion on a subject just because you knowa lot of facts and figures about it?

The morebooks I read, bigger is the realization that “I don’t know” is usually the mosthonest answer and also the toughest one, more so if the questions are aboutcomplex world around us.

Then whyis it that we find it so hard to acknowledge our ignorance?

I don’tknow the answer to that but my guess is that saying “I don’t know” puts thehuman ego at risk, and to avoid looking like fools, people end up talkingsomething which usually is crap.

That remindsme of this quote from Plato –

Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something.

This‘need to say something’ when one doesn’t have anything useful to say is whatCharlie Munger dubs as TwaddleTendency.

Theword ‘twaddle’ means a speech or writing that is silly, trivial, pretentiousand not true. In other words –nonsense.

Twaddletendency is the smoke screen created by shallow thinkers to hide theirignorance. The unnecessary jargons and pompous language is used to disguise theintellectual laziness and half-baked ideas.

Sometimesthis trick works, but only for a short while. And many a times this twaddletendency is so obvious that it’s embarrassing. See what happened with this girlwho ended making a big fool of herself.

It wasn’ther ignorance about the subject but her unwillingness to say, “I don’t know”that put her into real trouble. She felt she had to say something smart so shejust twaddled.

Likeother behavioural biases, this tendency is also tattooed deep into humanbehaviour and probably evolution is the culprit behind this. Often, if theperson is not prepared to answer he or she will simply make something upinstead of saying nothing at all.

RecentlyI met an accomplished value investor and asked his feedback about how to makeSafal Niveshak more valuable for its readers. Instead of falling for theTwaddle Tendency and make up something, he did the most honest thing.

He said,“I can’t give you an answer off the cuff. Let me think about it.” It’srare to find people like that.

Accordingto Munger, people waste a lot of time talking about meaningless stuff whichthen leads to equally meaningless activities.

In PoorCharlie’s Almanack, Charlie Munger describes an interesting experiment …

A trouble from the honeybee version of twaddle was once demonstratedin an interesting experiment. A honeybee normally goes out and finds nectar andthen comes back and does a dance that communicates to the other bees where thenectar is. The other bees then go out and get it.

Well some scientist, clever like B. F. Skinner [perhaps Charlie’sfavorite scientist], decided to see how well a honeybee would do with ahandicap. He put the nectar straight up. Way up. Well, in a natural setting,there is no nectar a long way straight up, and the poor honeybee doesn’t have ageneric program that is adequate to handle what she now has to communicate.

You might guess that this honeybee would come back to the hive andslink into a corner, but she doesn’t. She comes into the hive and does anincoherent dance. Well, all my life I’ve been dealing with the human equivalentof that honeybee. And it’s a very important part of wise administration to keepprattling people, pouring our twaddle, far away from the serious work.

In 1998Wesco meeting, Charlie added …

I try to get rid of people who always confidently answer questionsabout which they don’t have any real knowledge. To me they are like the beedancing its incoherent dance. They are just screwing up the hive.

Twaddleis perhaps harmless for the twaddler (if there is such word) except that heloses respect in the eyes of wise people. But if you’re at the receiving endand your bullshit filter isn’t strong enough to separate the twaddle from realtalk, then you run a risk of not only wasting your time hearing the trash talkbut may also end up losing your money and resources.

In fact,most of the talking heads on financial TV (even the non-financial ones) aredishing out twaddle.

CharlieMunger is quite fond of the word and has used it at multiple occasions.

It’s obvious that if a company generates high returns on capital andreinvests at high returns, it will do well. But this wouldn’t sell books, sothere’s a lot of twaddle and fuzzy concepts that have been introduced thatdon’t add much.

~ Charlie Munger, WESCO annual meeting, 2000

I think the notion that liquidity of tradable common stock is agreat contributor to capitalism is mostly twaddle. The liquidity gives us thesecrazy booms, so it has as many problems as virtues.

At [Farnam Street](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/), Shane Parrish writes…

While we all hold an opinion on almost everything, how many of us dothe work required to have an opinion?

The work is the hard part.

You have to do the reading. You have to talk to anyone you can findand listen to their arguments. You have to think about the key variables thatgovern the interests. You have to think about your biases and incentives.

You have to think not emotionally but rationally.

And you need to become your most intelligent critic. Part of doingthat means you need to have the intellectual honesty to kill some of your bestloved ideas.

Only then, when you can argue better against yourself than otherscan you hold an opinion.

After you’ve done that, after you’ve done the work, that is the timeyou can say “Hey, I can hold this view, because I can’t find anyone else whocan argue better against my view.”

Simplyregurgitating facts and anecdotes doesn’t add any value to an argument. Unlesssomebody has struggled with an idea and spent some mental energy thinking aboutit, his or her knowledge is pretty superficial, second hand and precursor to atwaddle.

Mungersays, “I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t knowthe other side’s argument better than they do.”

Unlessone qualifies Munger’s test to have an opinion, whatever he or she speaks on asubject, especially with overconfidence, is possibly just twaddle.

Inhis book [The Art of Thinking Clearly](http://www.amazon.in/Art-Thinking-Clearly-Rolf-Dobelli/dp/144475954X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1446569014&sr=8-1&keywords=art+of+thinking+clearly&tag=safanive-21), RolfDobelli summarizes the idea very well …

Verbal expression is the mirror of the mind. Clear thoughts becomeclear statements, whereas ambiguous ideas transform into vacant ramblings. Thetrouble is that, in many cases, we lack very lucid thoughts. The world iscomplicated, and it takes a great deal of mental effort to understand even onefacet of the whole. Until you experience such epiphany, it’s better to heedMark Twain: ‘If you have nothing to say, say nothing.’ Simplicity is the zenithof a long, arduous journey, not the starting point.

So how doyou identify a twaddle?

Wheneveryou hear a talk or read a statement with signs of overconfidence, colored withhindsight bias, suggesting anecdotal evidences, predictions about unknowables,and high sounding complicated jargons, you can be pretty sure that the personis either lying or mad and possibly both.

Having alatticework of mental models greatly helps in filtering out the balderdashthrown at you. Multidisciplinary thought process helps you build a strongbullshit filter.

Idon’t know who said this but there is some degree of truth to thisstatement –

Unsolicited advices are like armpits. Everyone has one and theystink.

Based onmy personal experience I know when something needs to be ignored – whensomebody pulls me aside and gives a free and especially an unsolicited advice.

Twaddle Tendency in Life

In Life:The twaddle tendency, if left unchecked, can result in a lot of lost time orresources. How to separate twaddle from meaningful work? Munger says, 'Arightly famous Caltech engineering professor, exhibiting more insight thantact, once expressed his version of this idea as follows: 'The principal job ofan academic administration is to keep the people who don't matter frominterfering with the work of the people that do'.'

Twaddle Tendency in Investing

Ininvesting: Twaddle shows its head in investing too. Think of the hundreds of TVexperts dishing out sermons on stocks and markets every day.

Anotherexample is of fund managers. A favourite strategy of fund houses is to packagefunds into value or growth and then sell them separately to investors who areinterested in either.

Accordingto Munger, 'The whole concept of dividing it up into 'value' and 'growth'strikes me as twaddle. It's convenient for a bunch of pension fund consultantsto get fees prattling about and a way for one adviser to distinguish himselffrom another. But, to me, all intelligent investing is value investing -acquiring more than you are paying for. You must value the business in order tovalue the stock.' This solves the problem for many of us who are concernedabout value and growth.

 

 

[Here’s how Elon Musk](http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-job-interview-rule-2013-12?IR=T) cuts through thetwaddle when he is recruiting people …

When you struggle with a problem that’s when you understand it…whenI interview people, I ask them to tell me about the problems that they workedon and how they solved them. And if someone is really the person who has solvedit then he would be able to answer it at multiple levels…if they aren’t thenyou can say ..oh! this isn’t the person who really solved the problem. Becauseanyone who struggles hard with a problem, never forgets it.

It’samazing how quickly you can find somebody’s edge of knowledge. Just ask why acouple of times and you can see how deeply that person has thought through theproblem or issue. That’s what Musk means by ‘multiple levels’.

And doyou know the most dangerous form of twaddle? It’s the one which you tellyourself.

Becausethe easiest person to fool is always yourself, says Richard Feynman.

So keepasking WHY from yourself. This simple trick will accelerate your learninglike anything.

Take careand keep learning.

 

 

Update: Our tribe member, Ankit Kanodia, sharedan example of annual report containing twaddle. You can download theannual report from [here](http://www.aceanalyzer.com/ar/AR2014/119260_201403.pdf). Check out page 16.The company, Sanwaria Agro Oils Limited, refers to itself asDabur. It’s not just a copy paste blunder, but shows how little thought theyhave put into their most important communication letter.
