In Aug2012 the stock was selling for around $53. On July 19th 2013 it is selling for$264.58. In less than 1 year the stock went up by 5 times. Looking at the pricetoday most of us will think why did I not see the obvious. If I had invested$10,000 I could have easily made $50,000. I have done this several times and Ihave seen most of my friends doing this over and over. This is a classicexample of hindsight bias. Wikipedia defines it as

Hindsight bias, also known as the knew-it-all-along effect orcreeping determinism, is the inclination to see events that have alreadyoccurred as being more predictable than they were before they took place.

Why does this happen?

In [Thinking Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555) – Daniel Kahnemanwrites

A general limitation of the human mind is its imperfect ability toreconstruct past states of knowledge, or beliefs that have changed. Once youadopt a new view of the world (or any part of it), you immediately lose much ofyour ability to recall what you used to believe before your mind changed.

Thehindsight bias will be very high when the consequence is worse.

In the case of a catastrophe, such as 9/11, we are especially readyto believe that the officials who failed to anticipate it were negligent orblind. On July 10,2001, the Central Intelligence Agency obtained informationthat al-Qaeda might be planning a major attack against the United States.George Tenet, director of the CIA, brought the information not to PresidentGeorge W.Bush but to National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. When the factslater emerged, Ben Bradlee, the legendary executive editor of The WashingtonPost, declared “It seems to me elementary that if you’ve got the story that’sgoing to dominate history you might as well go right to the president.”

OnJuly 10, no one knew – or couldhave known – that this tidbitof intelligence would turn out to dominate history.

Software Bugs

In thefield of software development hindsight bias happens a lot. Bugs in software isquite common. Most of them are minor and some of them end up being major.Recently we encountered a production issue, which made a piece of functionalityinaccessible for a couple of days. The root cause of the problem was found andthe issue got fixed. After the root cause was found one developer made thefollowing comment.

The bug was so obvious and why did the developer not see this whilecoding.

Of coursethe issue is obvious after we know it. During coding this was not obvious.

India vs Sri Lanka 1996 world cup semifinals

Do youremember the 1996 world cup semifinals between India and Sri Lanka at the EdenGardens stadium? India won the toss and put Sri Lanka into bat. I was surprisedby the decision. But I was quiet because the outcome is not yet known. WhenJayasuriya and Kaluwitharana got out after scoring only 1 run, I was veryhappy. I justified why putting Sri Lanka into bat was the right decision. Infact I was not the only one. Sri Lanka went on to scored 251/8 in 50overs. India chasing 252, lost 8 wickets and scored only 120 runsin 34.1 overs. The crowd interrupted the match and the match wasabandoned. Sri Lanka was declared as the winner.

Whathappened after that? I blamed the decision of putting Sri Lanka into bat as thecause for losing the match. With in few hours I changed my decision based onthe outcome. In fact I was not the only one the whole country was in ragebecause of that decision. After the match the captain of the indian cricketteam, told

It was a team decision which was taken by all the team members thatwhen we win the toss we will field.

DanielKahneman calls this as outcome bias.

When the outcomes are bad, the clients often blame their agents fornot seeing the handwriting on the wall – forgetting that it was written ininvisible ink that became legible only afterward.

Focus on the process and not on outcomes

Always focus on the process and not on the outcomes. Why? We do notcontrol the outcomes. Having a solid process will increase our odds ofsuccessful outcomes. Robert Edward Rubin is an American economist and bankingexecutive. He served as the 70th United States Secretary of the Treasury duringboth the first and second Clinton administrations. Before his governmentservice, he spent 26 years at Goldman Sachs, eventually serving as a member of the board, andco-chairman from 1990 to 1992. In the book [The Halo Effect](http://www.amazon.com/The-Halo-Effect-Business-Delusions/dp/0743291263) the author writes about Rubin’s experienceat Goldman Sachs

One memorable deal was the proposed 1967 acquisition by BectonDickinson of a rival company in the medical products industry, Univis. Underthe terms of the stock swap merger, one share of Univis would rise from itscurrent market price of $24 1/2 to about $33. When the deal was announced,Univis shares rose on questions – about whether the deal would come to pass.That was the question Rubin’s department had to answer. If Goldman Sachsbelieved the merger would succeed, it would buy Univis at $30 1/2 andenjoy the further rise to $33; but if it expected the deal to fall through, itmight sell Univis short. After much calculation, Goldman Sachs bought sharesin Univis. It stood to gain $125,000 if the merger went through, a tidychunk of change in 1967. But some weeks later, a disappointing earnings reportat Univis caused Becton Dickinson to withdraw its bid, and Goldman Sachs endedup losing $675,000-more than five times what it had hoped to gain. Naturallythere was a fair amount of second-guessing and finger pointing along thecorridors of Goldman Sachs, a normal reaction since many people infer that abad outcome is the result of a bad decision. But even though the result turnedout badly, Rubin knew the decision hadn’t necessarily been wrong. He explained:‘Even a large and painful loss doesn’t mean that we had misjudged anything. Aswith any actuarial business, the essence of arbitrage is that if you calculatethe odds correctly, you will make money on the majority of deals and on the sumtotal of all your deals. If you take a six-to-one risk, you will lose moneyevery seventh time. To an outsider, our business might have looked likegambling. In fact, it was the opposite of gambling, or at least of most amateurgambling. It was an investment business built on careful analysis, disciplinedjudgments often made under considerable pressure and the law of averages.” As aveteran of deal making at Goldman Sachs, Robert Rubin knew that roughly onedeal out of seven was likely to go bad. He and his colleagues tried to improvetheir success rate, sure, but they knew from experience that one loss out ofseven was likely and acceptable. If the loss rate went much lower, it mightsignal that Goldman was not taking enough risks, which would also be a seriousproblem. The optimal rate of failure wasn’t zero, any more than the optimalnumber of defaults on banks loans is zero. Just make sure that one loss doesn’tbreak the bank! This view of the world is based on an appreciation of probability.

Is there a solution?

Anytime you are faced with a situation to take a major decision in life – Daniel Kahneman recommends that

You should go down to the local drugstore and buy a very cheapnotebook and start keeping track of your decisions.

Why? In future if you want to know under whatcircumstances this decision was taken, you can go to the notebook and get theinformation. This way you can avoid the hindsight bias.

Beforethe start of every year, I write down the goals that I want to achieve for thenext year. I called this as yearbook. I started doing this from Dec 2007onwards. This is what I wrote on 1st Dec 2007 on why am I writing thisyearbook.

Why am I writing this yearbook

This is required to keep track of all our financial, career andhealth goals. Human brain is very powerful and sometimes funny too. Whatever Iwanted to achieve I have achieved it. But since I have not tracked it anywheremy brain thinks that I did not do anything. Hence I decided to keep track ofour

\1. Finances

\2. Career

\3. Health

\4. Any other goals

When Iwrote this in 2007 I never knew about hindsight bias. Keeping notes this wayhelped me a lot in avoiding the hindsight bias. In hindsight it makes sense!
