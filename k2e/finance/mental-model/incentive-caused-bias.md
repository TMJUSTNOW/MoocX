“PeopleRespond to incentives.” The rest is commentary.

 

Most of economics can be summarized in four words: “People Respondto incentives.” The rest is commentary- Steven Landsburg

What isit? On a very basic level, it is the tendency to respond to rewards andpunishments. Simple as it sounds, Munger cautions that even though we tend tothink that we recognise the importance of incentives and disincentives inchanging cognition and behaviour, that is often not the case.

 

Hereis an Excerpt From “[Seeking Wisdom From Darwin To Munger](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578644283)“

The organizers of a tennis tournament needed money. They approachedthe CEO of TransCorp and asked him to sponsor the tournament.

“How much?” asked the CEO.

“One million,” said the organizer.

“That is too much money,” said the CEO.

“Not if you consider the fact that you personally can play onematch, sit at the honorary stand next to a member of the presidential familyand be the one that hands over the prize,” said the organizer.

“Where do I sign?” said the CEO.

'If youwould persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason. This maxim is a wiseguide to a great and simple precaution in life: Never ever think aboutsomething else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives.'

Anextreme side of the incentive superpower brings about the 'incentive-causedbias', because of which even decent individuals, consciously or unconsciously,fall into immoral behaviour to get what they want by rationalising badbehaviour.

Examples 

Example - Freakonomics

Read thebook (and its sequel Superfreakonomics), watch the movie.

These twoguys have done some wonderful work on “incentives.”

Example - Demand Curve

Price andDemand are inversely related. Provide two exceptions where to increase demand,you should increase price.

\1. Priceassociated with quality

\2. Bribethe customer’s agent to push the product - invoking one the most post powerfulpsychological tendencies - the superpower of incentives

“Any time you create large differences in commissions wherethe guygets X% for selling A, which is some mundane thing, and 10 times X for sellingB, which is something toxic, you know what’s going to happen.” - Munger

You’ll get lots of B despite its toxicity.Moreover it will getrationalized. Man is not a rational animal,rather man is a rationalizinganimal. - Munger

I-C Biasis so pervasive it occurs in all professions. Lawyers make clients litigatemore than its necessary.

I lovethis quote... :

“Of the many advances in the long history of commerce, the advent ofsausage stands out as one of the greatest...

“The ideaof taking something which, in pure form, would be repellent to potentialcustomers, and by thorough grinding, mixing, reshaping and adulterating,creating an entirely new entity that could be marketed free from the taint ofits original ingredients, marked a milestone in the annals of business thought.Sausage making is the prototype for an entire class of merchandising techniquethat has become particularly common in modern ﬁnance. The ﬁnancial marketer whouses commingling as an approach is responding to the same general conditionsthat drive the sausage stuffer : an abundance of lower grade ingredients alongwith hungry and credulous public.” – Michael Aronstein

 

Be Waryof Financial Innovation…

 

The guyswho do it keep on re-inventing the wheel and hoodwink you into believing thatwhat they are doing “this time, its different.”

 

Galbraithonce wrote: “All ﬁnancialinnovation involves, in one form or another, the creation of debt secured ingreater or lesser adequacy by real assets … All crises have involved debt that,in one fashion or another, has become dangerously out of scale in relation tothe underlying means of payment.”

He wasright as you’ll discover when you read “The Great Crash 1929”

This is agreat movie which highlights a man who is a lobbyist for the tobacco industry,does a brilliant job, and faces no cognitive dissonance because he is doing it“for the money.”

 

Howevereverything changes in the last scene...

When youtake up a job, you will have the same problem. All professions have thisproblem of incentive-caused bias, when you fool yourself into believing thatwhat’s good for you is also good for your client. And so, you will ﬁnd yourselfselling overpriced and unsuitable insurance,addiction, unsuitable products(e.g. tech mutual funds on the top of a tech boom to widows and orphans) justfor the money...

 

I-C Biasis very pervasive. What’s the solution?

 

Accordingto Munger, the solution is ﬁnancialindependence.

 

“Whose bread i eat, his song i sing”

“Any timeyou create large differences in commissions where the guy gets X% for sellingA, which is some mundane thing, and 10 times X for selling B,which is somethingtoxic, you know what’s going to happen.”

“Fearprofessional advice especially when it is good for the advisor.”

“Doublecheck, disbelieve, or replace much of what you’re told, to the degree thatseems appropriate after objective thought”

Rather go to bed supperless than rise in debt - Ben franklin

This isthe story of a founding father of one of the greatest nations - USA,and thesubsequent behavior of its citizens and its businesses.This is the story ofdebt, and how it got pushed like a drug because there was “money in it”.

 

All youMUST read the following books by Franklin. 

 

PoorRichard’s Almanak

The Wayto Wealth

 

Franklingave some very valuable advice to his citizens…

look whatthey did and look how they were pushed into this by the“extremes of capitalism”

 

"Butwhat madness must it be to run in debt for these superﬂuities? We are offered by the terms of this sale, six months credit;and that, perhaps, has induced some of us to attend it, because we cannot sparethe ready money, and hope now to be ﬁne without it. But, ah! think what you dowhen, I you run I in debt you give to another power over your liberty. If youcannot pay at the time, you will be ashamed to see your creditor; you will bein fear when you speak to him; you will make poor, pitiful, sneakingexcuses,and, by degrees, come to lose your veracity, and sink into base,downright lying; for The second vice is lying, the ﬁrst is running in debt, asPoor Richard says.”

 

The loveof debt, like any addiction, WILL result in breakdown of morality.

Whypotential buyers even look at projections prepared by sellers baffles me.Charlie and In ever give them a glance, but instead keep in mind the story ofthe man with an ailing horse.Visiting the vet, he said: "Can you help me?Sometimes my horse walks just ﬁne and sometimes he limps." The vets replywas pointed: "No problem – when hes walking just ﬁne,sell him." ...At Berkshire, we have all the difficulties in perceiving the future that otheracquisition-minded companies do. Like they also, we face the inherent problemthat the seller of a business practically always knows far more about it thanthe buyer and also picks the time of sale – a time when the business is likelyto be walking "just ﬁne." – WB

Example  - Wall Street Casino

Buffett’scolumn: How to tame the casino society

Perverseincentives out of low brokerage costs.

How doesHE deal with incentives?

 

Example - Scott Fetzer

What’sCausing This???

“Insetting compensation, we like to hold out the promise of large carrots, butmake sure their delivery is tied directly to results in the area that a managercontrols. When capital invested in an operation is significant, we also bothcharge managers a high rate for incremental capital they employ and credit themat an equally high rate for capital they release.

 

“Theproduct of this moneys-not-free approach is definitely visible at Scott Fetzer.If Ralph can employ incremental funds at good returns, it pays him to do so:His bonus increases when earnings on additional capital exceed a meaningfulhurdle charge. “But our bonus calculation is symmetrical: If incrementalinvestment yields sub-standard returns, the shortfall is costly to Ralph aswell as to Berkshire. The consequence of this two- way arrangement is that itpays Ralph - and pays him well - to send to Omaha any cash he cantadvantageously use in his business.”

 

Example - GEICO

“Thebonuses received by dozens of top executives,s tarting with Tony, are basedupon only two key variables:(1) growth in voluntary auto policies and (2)underwriting profitability on “seasoned” auto business (meaning policies thathave been on the books for more than one year).”

 

Example - H.H. Brown

“Adistinguishing characteristic of H. H. Brown is one of the most unusualcompensation systems I’ve encountered - but one that warms my heart: A numberof key managers are paid an annual salary of $7,800, to which is added adesignated percentage of the profits of the company after these are reduced bya charge for capital employed. These managers therefore truly stand in theshoes of owners.”

“Incontrast, most managers talk the talk but don't walk the walk, choosing insteadto employ compensation systems that are long on carrots but short on sticks(and that almost invariably treat equity capital as if it were cost-free). Thearrangement at Brown, in any case, has served both the company and its managersexceptionally well, which should be no surprise: Managers eager to bet heavilyon their abilities usually have plenty of ability to bet on.”

 

Example - Ending the deficit

“If youwere to persuade, appeal to interest not reason” - Ben Franklin

 

IC Bias in various forms 

In Life

Money isone of the biggest incentives that drives people's habits, says Munger. 'A richperson will often, through habit, work or connive energetically for more moneylong after he has almost no real need for more. Money rewards are alsointertwined with other forms of reward. For instance, some people use money tobuy status and others use status to get money, while still others sort of doboth things at the same time.'

There areother rewards that act as incentives: sex, friendship, companionship,advancement in status, and other nonmonetary items. They act in a similarfashion to change or influence behaviour.

And thenthere is 'Granny's Rule', which, according to Munger, provides an example ofreward superpower that works with astounding success. What is it? 'Therequirement that children eat their carrots before they get the dessert.'According to Munger, 'You can successfully manipulate your own behaviour withthis rule, even if you are using as rewards items that you already possess!'

In corporations

The mostimportant rule in management, according to Munger, is to get the incentivesright. That, as Munger illustrates, FedEx found after trying all tricks in itsbooks.

'One ofmy favorite cases about the power of incentives is the Federal Express case.The integrity of the Federal Express system requires that all packages beshifted rapidly among airplanes in one central airport each night. And thesystem has no integrity for the customers if the night work shift can'taccomplish its assignment fast. And Federal Express had one hell of a timegetting the night shift to do the right thing. They tried moral suasion. Theytried everything in the world without luck. And, finally, somebody got thehappy thought that it was foolish to pay the night shift by the hour when whatthe employer wanted was not maximized billable hours of employee service butfault-free, rapid performance of a particular task. Maybe, this person thought,if they paid the employees per shift and let all night shift employees go homewhen all the planes were loaded, the system would work better. And, lo andbehold, that solution worked.'

Whathappens when you or corporations ignore 'the incentives are superpowers'concept? You get what the Soviet Communists used to get from their labour:'They pretend to pay us and we pretend to work.'

The powerof incentives is also most visible in owner-run companies compared topublic-sector companies. Whereas owners survive brutal competition bypreventing all wasteful operational expenditure, that incentive is often absentin a public-sector unit whose employee functions with the incentive-caused biasto determine 'what service he will give in exchange for his salary and how muchhe will yield to peer pressure from many fellow employees who do not desire hiscreation of any strong performance model.'

In Investing

Thelessons are often direct in investing. Should you trade more on the tips thatyour stockbroker provides regularly? Do you sell your stock that has made gainsonly because it has met your broker's target price? What is your portfoliomanager's incentive behind churning your investments?

Mungeradvises how we can arm ourselves. 'Widespread incentive-caused bias requiresthat one should often distrust, or take with a grain of salt, the advice ofone's professional advisor. The general antidotes here are: (1) especially fearprofessional advice when it is especially good for the advisor; (2) learn anduse the basic elements of your advisor's trade as you deal with your advisor;and (3) double check, disbelieve, or replace much of what you're told, to thedegree that seems appropriate after objective thought.'

 

What should I do

Do notautomatically trust people who have something at stake from your decisions. AskWhat are their interests? Who benefits?
