Thethree most important words in investing are “margin of safety”, which means“always building a 15,000 pound bridge if you’re going to be driving 10,000pound trucks across it.”

“No matter how wonderful [a business] is, it’s notworth an infinite price.

We have to have a price that makes sense and gives amargin of safety

considering the normal vicissitudes of life.”

~Charlie Munger

“Ifyou were to distill the secret of sound investment into three words”, wroteBenjamin Graham in Chapter 20 of The Intelligent Investor, “we venture themotto, MARGIN OF SAFETY.” Simply put, Graham’s margin of safety is the differencebetween a stock’s price and its intrinsic value. In theory, the further astock’s price is below its intrinsic value, the greater the margin of safetyagainst future uncertainty and the greater the stock’s resiliency to marketdownturns.

Themajority of investors will encounter various stumbling blocks and bad luck overtheir investing lifetime; a marginof safety will provide them with some protection interms of preservation of capital when the going gets tough.

In his speech – [The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville](http://www.safalniveshak.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Superinvestors-of-Graham-Doddsville-Warren-Buffett.pdf) – Warren Buffett defined margin of safety as “buying 1 dollar for 50cents.”

Buffettsaid…

You also have to have the knowledge toenable you to make a very general estimate about the value of the underlyingbusinesses. But you do not cut it close. That is what Ben Graham meant byhaving a margin of safety. You don’t try and buy businesses worth 83millionfor

80 million. You leave yourself an enormous margin. When you build abridge, you insist it can carry 30,000 pounds, but you only drive 10,000-poundtrucks across it. And that same principle works in investing.

Investing operation

An investmentoperation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principaland a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative. -Graham 

 Why did he use the phrase “InvestmentOperation?”

\1. Itsthe act of buying and selling a security

2. Infy in March 2000 and Infy today

3.Cannot say that a good company is a good investment 

Why did he use the word “promises?”

1.Investingis a probabilistic activity. There are winners and losers. No commitment ismade when there is an expectancy of a loss - e.g. you don’t BUY lottery ticketsor play in the casino.

2.Thereare no sure things.

Why did he put “safety of principal” before“satisfactory return?”

The correct association is between investment and the presence of a margin of safety and speculation and theabsence of a margin of safety.

BuffetSays:

“We insist on a marginof safety in our purchase price. If we calculate thevalue of a common stock to be only slightly higher than its price, we're notinterested in buying. We believe this margin-of-safety principle, so stronglyemphasized by Ben Graham, to be the cornerstone of investment success.”

Redundancy in Engineering

 TheIdea of “Margin of Safety” is based on the idea of Redundancy in Engineering.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Redundancy_(engineering)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%20Redundancy_%28engineering%29)

“Duplication ofcritical components of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of thesystem, usually in the case of a backup or fail- safe...

 

Inmany safety-critical systems, such as fly-by-wire aircraft, some parts of thecontrol system may be triplicated. An error in one component may then be out-voted by the other two.

 

“Ina triply redundant system, the system has three sub components, all three of whichmust fail before the system fails. Since each one rarely fails, and the sub componentsare expected to failindependently, the probability of all three failingis calculated to be extremelysmall .”

Investing Involves Risk, Uncertainty and Ignorance

Whenyou make an investment the laws of probability apply since the decisionsinvolves risk, uncertainty and ignorance. 

Manypeople make the mistake of assuming that buying a quality business ensuressafety. A Titan Industries or a Hero Motocorp may be a quality company with anattractive business, but that alone is not enough since the price you pay for ashare of stock matters.

JustDial may be an important company with lots of clicks and page views to putadvertising on, but it is not worth an infinite price.

AsHoward Marks puts it best in his book [The Most Important Thing](http://bit.ly/16BYbdx)…

…most investors think quality, as opposed to price, is thedeterminant of whether something’s risky. But high quality assets can be risky,and low quality assets can be safe. It’s just a matter of the price paid forthem….Elevated popular opinion, then, isn’t just the source of low returnpotential, but also of high risk.

Similarly,just because the price of share of stock in a company is beaten down fromformerly high levels does not make it “safe” to buy. 

Asan example, Zylog Systems is way off its value of a few years ago, but thatalone does not necessarily make the purchase of the stock “safe” in terms of a margin of safety.

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/F6742B77-CA0C-3B4F-9380-7CCC8C944548.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i8GW2KHdSA0/VmCHoNcmniI/AAAAAAAA4C8/S-bLDW3FO5Q/s1600/mos02-lesson42_image1.png)

Ortake, for that matter, Suzlon, IVRCL, and Unitech that are down 60-90% over thepast five years. Just because the prices of these stocks are beaten down fromformerly high levels does not make them “safe” to buy. The margin of safetyconcept is about making it likely that you have the odds significantly in yourfavour by trying to find a substantial cushion in terms of the odds.

CharlieMunger, for example, does not believe that this happens very often, particularwhen a business is in your circle of competence and the other investing filtersare in place. 

Sincefinding a significantly mispriced bet does not happen very often, when it doeshappen you should bet big. 

Mungersays that this means most of the time an investor should be just sitting – reading and talking to people.

Buyingand selling stocks just to stay busy is a very bad idea.

AsMunger said in his famous speech, [A Lesson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom](http://www.safalniveshak.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Lesson-on-Elementary-Worldly-Wisdom-Charlie-Munger.pdf),and something we studied in Lesson #16 on how to think about the stock market…

It’s not given to human beings to have such talent that they canjust know everything about everything all the time. But it is given to humanbeings who work hard at it – who look and sift the world for a mispriced bet –that they can occasionally find one.

And the wise ones bet heavily when the world offers them thatopportunity. They bet big when they have the odds. And the rest of the timethey don’t. It’s just that simple.

LasVegas has been built upon the wealth transfers that occur when people engage inseemingly-small  disadvantageous capital transactions

 

 InAmerican roulette there are 38 slots numbered 1-36, 0, and 00. Pay-out is 35:1.If you bet Re 1 on your lucky # 8 and if the ball lands on # 8, you win Rs 35,otherwise you lose Re 1.

 

Youwager Rs 1,000 on a single number, say number 7.

Probabilityof ball landing on 7 = 1/38 = 2.63%.

Probabilityof not landing on 7 = 37/38 = 97.37%

 

Basedon this NPV of American Roulette:

Whathappens when Margin of Safety is -ve and you practice wide diversification?

Supposeyou bet Rs 1000/38 or Rs 26.32 on each of the 38 numbers to “spread your risk”

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/C8ED9BD3-27A2-D646-8090-A6E8A37A831E.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eHXTx4qlhTM/Vowjhz6D4PI/AAAAAAAA6cc/Qbr6Gf7Fl3A/s1600/american_roulette_allballs_npv.png)

 

Lesson:Diversification does not work when Margin of Safety is absent.

 

 Infact diversification hurts you when margin of safety is negative.

In theearlier case when you bet Rs 1,000 on a single number, at least you had a smallchance of getting lucky and winning Rs 35,000. In the fully diversifiedstrategy, you will ALWAYS lose.

 

Thecasino is a value investor. Why?

Eachbet has an expectancy of a profit even though some will inevitably result in a loss

Widediversification

Cap on Max Bet

 

In order to take proper advantage of the margin-of-safety principlein investment operations, its almost always essential that the investorpractices adequate diversification. - Graham

Amargin of safety does notguarantee an investment against loss; it merely guarantees thatthat probabilities are against loss - and in case of common stocks, thatthe probabilities favor an ultimate profit... - Graham

 

Theindividual probabilities may be turned into a reasonable approximation of certaintyby the well -known practice of “spreading the risk. - Graham

 

Lookfor high base rates strategies - this does NOT mean look for high probabilityof success in every bet. Taleb’s bleed - frequency magnitude.

Avoidlow base rate strategies i.e. where margin of safety is negative.

 

This isthe cornerstone of the insurance business, and it should be the cornerstone ofsound investment.

Whileour process does a ow us to unearth undervalued stocks, we usua y do not knowhow or when a gain  om a particular stock will  occur.

In factsometimes we lose money on a particular stock even though it appears to beundervalued.

However,we do know that there are profit producing occurrences in a diversifiedportfolio of undervalued securities such as the general rise in market prices,special dividends, tender offers, mergers, recapitalizations, spinoffs,purchases of shares by raiders, and corporate share repurchases.”

Modern finance has given us ways to measure risk and ways to reduceit-diversification and hedging, for example-but modern finance does not dealwith a primary source of risk: the risk of paying too much for an investment. -Steven Penman

“To deliver efficient prices, modern investment theory requiresinvestors to mentally visualize a myriad of covariances, risk factors, riskpremiums, and expected returns, all of which vary randomly through timeaccording to some “stochastic process.” Quite demanding; my head hurts. Sorry,I failed the rational man test.” - Steven Penman

Architectsand engineers well know, safe and effective design rests on firm underlyingprinciples (of the physical sciences). Otherwise, the house or bridge fallsdown. 

 

 

Stock Markets Aren’t Rational

Mostpeople believe that stock markets are rational – that stock prices reflect the true value of a company, always. Butthat is not the case. And you can prove that easily. 

Look atthe big ups and downs in the markets. You don’t need to go further than 2008and 2009 when first stocks crashed 80-90%, and then surged 3-4 times. During atwo year period, a company business value cannot get 80% lower neither can itrise 3-4 times in a span of a few months.

Whatcrashes and then surges is the stock price, and this justifies that stockmarkets are not rational.

Sensibleinvestors – value investors – who follow the margin of safetyprinciple generally take advantage of such market volatility. And this makesthem stand apart from the crowd in the long term.

Valueinvestor Seth Klarman in his classic book Margin of Safety writes…

Because investing is as much an art as a science, investors need a margin of safety.A margin of safety is achieved when securities are purchased at prices sufficientlybelow underlying value to allow for human error, bad luck, or extremevolatility in a complex, unpredictable, and rapidly changing world.

According to Graham, ‘The margin of safety is always dependent on theprice paid. For any security, it will be large at one price, small at somehigher price, nonexistent at some still higher price.’

WarrenBuffett describes margin ofsafety concept using this example – “When you build abridge, you insist it can carry 30,000 pounds, but you only drive 10,000-poundtrucks across it. And that same principle works in investing.”

Comingagain to the question of what is an adequate margin of safety, the answer variesfrom one investor to the next. But, as Klarman writes, it chiefly depends on – 

1. How much     bad luck are you willing and able to tolerate? 
2. How much volatility in     business values can you absorb? 
3. What is the tolerance for     error? 

Inshort, it all boils down tohow much you can afford to lose. 

Talkingabout losses, assume that you buy a stock at Rs 100 when its intrinsic value isRs 100. If the stock crashes to Rs 20 within a year after you buy it, it wouldhave to rise by five times (or 400%) to just reach its original price, or matchthe intrinsic value of the business.

But ifyou had bought the stock at say Rs 60, and it crashes to Rs 20, it needs torise just three times to go back to your original buying price. While even athree times rise will be like too much for the asking, you will still be in abetter position than what you had been had you bought the stock for Rs 100.

Soif you think you cannot afford to lose much from your stocks, it always pays tohave a good margin of safety, say around 30-40%. This means that you must buy Rs 100 stock fornot more than Rs 60-70.

You Will Make Mistakes!

Makingmistakes and losing some money is an inevitable part of investing.

Infact, there is nothing you can do to prevent it. But to be a sensible andintelligent investor, you must take responsibility for ensuring that you neverlose most or all of your money.

Usingthe margin of safety concept, and by refusing to pay too much for an investment, youminimise the chances that your wealth will ever disappear or suddenly bedestroyed.

Whatyou are trying to do when making an investment is to find a mispriced bet. Whatmargin of safety is all about is finding a “significantly” mispriced bet.

SethKlarman writes…

A margin of safety is achieved when securities are purchased at prices sufficientlybelow underlying value to allow for human error, bad luck, or extremevolatility in a complex, unpredictable and rapidly changing world.

The bad news for some people in all of this is that investing ishard. But the good news is also that investing is hard and if you have theright temperament and are willing to do the necessary work the process can befun.

AsCharlie Munger has said…

If (investing) weren’t a little difficult, everybody would be rich.

Tobetter deal with inevitable mistakes we all make as human beings, you shouldhave built into the process a “margin” of sufficient size which ensures thateven if mistakes happen the outcome will be “adequate”, as Ben Grahamdescribes. 

Toquote Munger again…

In engineering, people have a big margin of safety. But in thefinancial world, people don’t give a damn about safety. They let it balloon andballoon and balloon. It’s aided by false accounting.

Whenengineers are building a bridge, they ensure that it is significantly strongerthan necessary to deal with the very worst case. The same principle works ininvesting.

Summing Up

Inhis brilliant paper called [Seven Immutable Laws of Investing](http://www.safalniveshak.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/JM_SevenImmutableLaws_312.pdf), JamesMontier wrote…

Valuation is the closest thing to the law of gravity that we have infinance. It is the primary determinant of long-term returns. However, theobjective of investment (in general) is not to buy at fair value, but topurchase with a margin ofsafety. This reflects that any estimate of fair valueis just that: an estimate, not a precise figure, so the margin of safetyprovides a much-needed cushion against errors and misfortunes.

When investors violate [this principle] by investing with no margin of safety,they risk the prospect of the permanent impairment of capital.

Finally,this is what Howard Marks wrote in [The Most Important Thing](http://bit.ly/16BYbdx)…

It’s not hard to make investments that will be successful if thefuture unfolds as expected. There’s little mystery in how to profit under theassumption that the economy will go a certain way and particular industries andcompanies will do better than others.

Tightly targeted investments can be highly successful if the futureturns out as you hope. But you might want to give some thought to how you’llfare if the future doesn’t oblige.

In short, what is it that makes outcomes tolerable even when thefuture doesn’t live up to your expectations? The answer is ‘margin for error’.

So,insist on a margin of error or margin ofsafety in your purchase price. If you calculate thevalue of a stock to be only slightly higher than its price, don’t be interestedin buying.

Thismargin of safety principle, so strongly emphasized by Ben Graham, is and wouldalways remain the cornerstone of investment success…your investment success.
