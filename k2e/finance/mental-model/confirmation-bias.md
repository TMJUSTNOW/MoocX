In Hindi:  

Theconfirmation bias is the tendency to seek information that confirms priorconclusions and to ignore evidence to the contrary.

Theimportance of understanding this source of Psychological Misjudgment isenormous. Once you become aware of the confirmation bias you realize that itpermeates your decision making process.

Severalbiases emerge from the confirmation heuristic: confirmation bias, anchoring,conjunctive and disjunctive events bias, overconfidence, and hindsight bias.

Anexample of the confirmation bias can be found in a 1960 experiment from PeterWason.

Imaginethat the sequence of three numbers below follows a rule, and that your task isto diagnose that rule. When you write down other sequences of the three numbersyour instructor will tell you whether or not your sequences follow the rule.

2-4-6

Whatsequences would you write down? How would you know when you had enough evidenceto guess the rule? Wason’s study participants tented to offer fairly fewsequences, and the sequences tended to be consistent with the rule that theyeventually guessed. Commonly proposed rules included “numbers that go up bytwo” and “the difference between the first two numbers equals the differencebetween the last two numbers.”

In fact,Wason’s rule was much broader: “any three ascending numbers.” This solutionrequires participants to accumulate disconfirming, rather than confirming,evidence. Wason concluded that the correct solution necessitates “a willingnessto attempt to falsify hypotheses, and thus to test those intuitive ideas thatso often carry the feeling of certitude.”

In [Judgment in Managerial Decision Making](http://www.amazon.com/Judgment-Managerial-Decision-Making-Bazerman/dp/0470049456?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969), Harvard Professor Max Bazerman writes:

As teachers we have presented this task hundreds of times inclasses. The first volunteer typically guesses “numbers going up by two” and isquickly eliminated. The second volunteer is often just as quick with a wronganswer. Interestingly, at this stage, it is rare that a volunteer will haveproposed a sequences that doesn’t conform to the rule. Why? Because peoplenaturally tent to seek information that confirms their expectations andhypotheses, even when disconfirming or falsifying information is more useful.

When wecome across information that is consistent with our beliefs, we usually acceptit with ease. Our bias is to uncritically accept information unless there is anunavoidable reason to doubt it. Yet when we discover facts that force us toquestion our beliefs, we pass it through a different filter: “Must I believethis?” In other words, we wonder whether we can dismiss the disconfirmingevidence.

Thiswas nicely captured by Dan Gilbert, author of [Stumbling on Happiness](http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/1400077427?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969), in an op-ed forthe New York Times. Gilbert wrote, “when our bathroom scale delivers bad news,we hop off and then on again, just to make sure we didn’t misread the displayor put too much pressure on one foot. When our scale delivers good news, we smileand head for the shower. By uncritically accepting evidence when it pleases us,and insisting on more when it doesn’t, we subtly tip the scales in our favor.”Gilbert knows what he’s talking about.

There aretwo main reasons that we fall prey to confirmation bias. The first has to dowith the way the human mind retrieves information from memory. Gilbert arguedin a 1991 research paper (How Mental Systems Believe) that considering certainhypotheses ensures that we retrieve information that is consistent with thathypotheses. As Bazerman describes it “the mere consideration of certainhypotheses makes information that is consistent with these hypothesesselectively accessible.” The second way we fall victim to the confirmation biasis how we search for information. Our minds try to conserve energy. This meanswe selectively search for information where we are most likely to find it.Consequently we fall into retrieval bias.

Tverskyand Kahneman (1983) demonstrated the retrievability bias when they askedparticipants in their study to estimate the frequency of seven letter wordswith an “n” in the sixth position. Participants in the study estimated thatsuch words were less common than seven-letter words ending in the morememorable three-letter “ing” sequence. Careful readers have no doubt noted thatall words with seven letters that end in “ing” also have an “n” as their sixthletter. It is impossible for the frequency of seven-letter words that end in“ing” to be larger than the number of seven-letter words with an “n” as thesixth letter. Tversky and Kahneman explained this by arguing that “ing” wordsare more retrievable from memory because of the commonly ending “ing” suffix.On the other hand, it’s mentally intensive to come up with seven-letter wordsthat have an “n” as the sixth letter.

Anotherconsequence of our our minds desire to expend as little energy as possible isthat we give special weight to information that allows us to come to theconclusion we want to reach (Kunda, 1990, The Case for Motivated Reasoning).

In tryingto save energy, our minds search for information in a way that almost ensuresour interpretation of the evidence is biased.

Warren Buffett offers the following: 

What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all newinformation so that their prior conclusions remain intact.

Charlie Munger says this about Charles Darwin and theconfirmation bias: 

…the great example of Charles Darwin is he avoided confirmationbias. Darwin probably changed my life because I’m a biography nut, and when Ifound out the way he always paid extra attention to the disconfirming evidenceand all these little psychological tricks. I also found out that he wasn’t verysmart by the ordinary standards of human acuity, yet there he is buried inWestminster Abbey. That’s not where I’m going, I’ll tell you. And I said, “MyGod, here’s a guy that, by all objective evidence, is not nearly as smart as Iam and he’s in Westminster Abbey? He must have tricks I should learn.” And Istarted wearing little hair shirts like Darwin to try and train myself out ofthese subconscious psychological tendencies that cause so many errors. It didn’twork perfectly, as you can tell from listening to this talk, but it would’vebeen even worse if I hadn’t done what I did. And you can know thesepsychological tendencies and avoid being the patsy of all the people that aretrying to manipulate you to your disadvantage, like Sam Walton. Sam Waltonwon’t let a purchasing agent take a handkerchief from a salesman. He knows howpowerful the subconscious reciprocation tendency is. That is a profoundlycorrect way for Sam Walton to behave.
