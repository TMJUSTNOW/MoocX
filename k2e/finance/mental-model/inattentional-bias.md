“Whereis it?” I asked my wife, while my eyes scanned the kitchen cupboard again. Iwas looking for the sugar jar. The plan was to impress her with myexceptional tea making skills which I acquired after watching few YouTubevideos.

“Itshould be there. Right in front!” informed my wife from the other room.

“It’snot here. I can’t see it.” I again scanned all the shelves in the cupboard.

“Lookagain. I kept it there in the morning.” My wife sounded very sure about it.

“No!It’s not here. I am sure.” I confirmed while closing the cupboard. Whathappened next shouldn’t be surprising for you because most of you haveexperienced it before.

Shecame, opened the cupboard, grabbed the sugar jar which was obviously sittingright in front and handed over to me. I stood there flabbergasted. How could Imiss it? What’s wrong with my eyes? Have I gone blind? It felt as if the jarmanifested itself out of thin air. It was like…magic.

Haven’t you experienced something similar in yourlife? I see a smile on your face. 🙂

Nowthat embarrassing episode in the kitchen may look like a minor incident but itholds an important clue to a fascinating behavioural bias inherent in everyhuman brain. It’s called Inattentional Blindness,which means not being able to see things that are actually there.

May be you’re thinking, “Well, I am not one ofthose. You can’t fool me and I always find the sugar box in my kitchen.” Okay,let’s test that. 🙂

Picka card, any card. Keep it in your mind; Better, write it down if you have apoor short term memory.

I’llcome back to this card trick little later in this post.

## Are You Paying Attention?

Letme throw a challenge at you. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo) to test yourattention.

Don’tread further. If you skipped the video, you’ll miss the fun because I amgoing to spill the beans in the next few lines. Come on, watch the video andthen come back. I promise, I’ll be waiting for you, right here.

DanielSimons, who designed this experiment in collaboration with Christopher Chabris,writes –

Chabrisand I have studied this phenomenon of inattentional blindness for many years.Our best-known study was based on earlier work by Ulric Neisser: We askedsubjects to count how many times three players wearing white shirts passed abasketball while ignoring players wearing black who passed their own ball. Wefound that about 50 percent of subjects failed to notice when a person in agorilla suit unexpectedly walked through the scene.

Themismatch between what we see and what we think we see has profound implicationson how we make decisions in our life. Moreover, what’s scary about theinvisible gorilla experiment is that even experts fall for this, as suggestedby this [study](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/the-really-scary-invisibl_b_2574791).

## The Secret of Illusion

Inattentionalblindness is the secret behind the illusions created by most professionalmagicians, especially those who are expert in performing those entertainingsleight of hand tricks. You would be surprised to know, as I was when I firstdiscovered this, that the key to performing magic tricks is to manipulate andmanage people’s attention.

Letme give you a quick primer on how magic works.

Yourattention is like a surveillance system which is constantly focussed on widearray of external stimuli coming from all directions. Your mind is always busyprocessing those stimuli. It’s like a CCTV camera capturing everything andrecording it into memory.

Interestingly,there is a limited supply of attention for everybody at any given moment. Andthis limited resource can obviously be spent on limited things. The moment youare distracted, like trying to answer a question which requires you to recallsomething from your memory, the link between your surveillance system and thememory gets severed for few seconds and whatever you see doesn’t get registeredin your memory because the memory is engaged in attending to distraction. Andwhen your mind can’t attend to something, it can’t be aware of it.

Amagician uses his voice (distraction by funny remarks or asking questions), hiseyes (he looks in that direction where he wants you to look at) and his onehand (while his other hand, which is not visible to you, is doing the trick) tocreate host of external stimuli to drown your attention in it. What he istrying is basically forcing you to spend your limited stock of attention onthings where he wants you to spend your attention. He is virtually stealingyour attention!

Sinceour attention steers our perception and controls our reality, when a magiciancontrols your attention he essentially hacks into your perception of reality.

ApolloRobbins, a deception specialist, explains that attention can be localized to aframe – a small window of space created to focus attention. Manoeuvres outsideof the frame are rarely noticed. Magicians, with thousands of hours ofpractice, master the art of misdirection. You may feel that you’re in completecontrol, but you’re literally a magician’s puppet while he is surfing throughyour attention

Nowdon’t get me wrong as I am not saying that everybody is prone to miss theinvisible gorilla. There are individual differences among people. But researchshows that the variability across people is far smaller than the similaritiesamong us.

Whilesome people may notice a bit more than others, we all have severe limits on howmuch of the world around us actually reaches our awareness at any moment.

## We Don’t Know that We Don’t Know

Thefirst problem with inattentional blindness, as we saw above, is our failure tonotice unexpected events that fall outside the focus of our attention. But ifyou really think about it, inattentional blindness in itself isn’t such a bigproblem. I mean missing the sugar box isn’t such a show stopper and neitherdoes the gorilla (or the man inside the costume) feel neglected.

Whatmakes this shortcoming critical is that we are largely oblivious to the limitsof perception, attention, and awareness; we think that we are far more likelyto notice unexpected events than we actually are. It’s our overconfidence inour abilities and perception.

Inthe real world, due to extreme complexity and randomness, there is an invisiblemagician who is busy pulling out gorillas from thin air. Question is, are youexpecting to see those gorillas which are going to show up sooner or later?

Becauseof unawareness about fallibility of our perception, we lower our guards andunderestimate the uncertainty inherent in the world around us.

Lookat all those people who use their smartphones while driving. They haveoverconfidence in their abilities to multitask. They fail to realize that theyaren’t just putting their own lives at risk but becoming a hazard for otherstoo. And when they get into an accident they have only one excuse – “I justdidn’t see that coming.”

Similarly,illusion of knowledge makes us overconfident and we miss the obvious. Ithappens when we have a big project to complete, a problem to solve, or anassignment to do. We give in to the temptation to dive in and get startedimmediately. Instead we should first examine our understanding of the task andits requirements.

PeterBevelin, in his masterful book, Seeking Wisdom, says that we only see stimuliwe encounter or that grabs our attention, and neglect important missinginformation. He further explains –

Wereact to stimuli that we personally encounter or that grabs our attention. Wereact more strongly to the concrete and specific than to the abstract. Weoverweigh personal experiences over vicarious. We see only what we have namesfor. We tend to focus only on the present information rather than whatinformation may potentially be missing. For example, when planning, we oftenplace too much importance on the specific future event and not enough on otherpossible events and their consequences that can cause the event to be delayedor not happen.

## In Investing

Whilereplying to one of the questions asked by Vishal, Prof. Bakshi replied –

Theabsence of something we expect to see or happen is information and a clue initself.

“Isthere any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?”

“Tothe curious incident of the dog in the night-time.”

“Thedog did nothing in the night-time.”

“Thatwas the curious incident,” remarked Sherlock Holmes.

Howcan we use this example? Let me tell you how. Imagine that there is a commodityindustry whose profitability is highly volatile because the price of the rawmaterial it consumes is quite volatile. When the raw material price rises, theprofitability of the industry falls dramatically because the industry haslittle pricing power. But then you notice that there is this one business inthat very industry who is like Sherlock’s dog who doesn’t bark – itsprofitability is not impacted at all. Now, isn’t that amazing? Isn’t that worthinvestigating? I think it is.

Soyou put on your detective hat and ask why this business is different? And ifyou keep doing this, once in a while you’ll find a pattern that’s different forone or more very good reasons which you understand and which you think aresustainable.

Thisis how you stumble upon treasures. You are, in a way, like a treasure hunter ora detective who is really looking for unusual patterns that kind of stand outand that would make someone like Sherlock Holmes stop and think. And in worldof stock picking, there are all kinds of unusual patterns that are worthinvestigating but trust me, you are not likely to find them reported to you ina newspaper. You have to do your own digging and thinking.

Whenlooking for information, don’t drown your attention in the noise created bynewspapers and other popular financial media. Prefer quality over quantity.

Duringbull markets we get so engrossed in the noise about multibaggers that we missthe obvious future wealth compounders lying in plain sight.

Whenyou’re reading the annual report, don’t just focus on what the management istrying to tell you. Focus also on what they might be trying to hide from you.Don’t just pay attention to what’s disclosed, pay attention to what’s notdisclosed. The management might be a magician who is trying to misdirect andmanipulate your attention.

## Conclusion

Sometimesour two eyes aren’t enough to see the obvious. Inattentional Blindness hidesfrom us what’s right in front of our eyes. I would like to say this again– attention is a powerful thing and it shapes our reality.

Soplease pay attention and please, please, please don’t talk on the cell phone(or text) while driving. It’s very dangerous.
