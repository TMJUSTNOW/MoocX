What isit? Many of us rush to a decision so that any doubts we have about the decisionare quickly eliminated. The decision taken under the influence of thedoubt-avoidance tendency may not always be rational or objective. Says Munger,'The brain of a man is programmed with a tendency to quickly remove doubt byreaching some decision.'

 

Like thedislike/hate tendency, Munger views this tendency as an ancient make-up thatbeen a part of evolution. 'It is easy to see how evolution would make animals,over the eons, drift toward such quick elimination of doubt. After all, the onething that is surely counterproductive for a prey animal that is threatened bya predator is to take a long time in deciding what to do. And so man'sdoubt-avoidance tendency is quite consistent with the history of his ancient,nonhuman ancestors.' You could also think of this tendency as a survivaltactic.

 

Whattriggers the doubt-avoidance tendency? 'Well, an unthreatened man, thinking ofnothing in particular, is not being prompted to remove doubt through rushing tosome decision. What usually triggers the doubt-avoidance tendency is somecombination of (l) puzzlement and (2) stress. And both of these factorsnaturally occur in facing religious issues. Thus, the natural state of most menis in some form of religion. And this is what we observe.'

Impact of Doubt Avoidance Tendency

In Life 

In Life:Not only ordinary citizens but persons in responsible places like judges andjurors too are susceptible to this tendency. How does one then overcome thistendency? Munger says, 'So pronounced is the tendency in a man to quicklyremove doubt by reaching some decision that behavior to counter the tendency isrequired from judges and jurors. Here, delay before decision making is forced.And one is required to so comport himself, prior to conclusion time, so that heis wearing a 'mask' of objectivity. And the 'mask' works to help realobjectivity along.'

In investing 

Ininvesting: The doubt-avoidance tendency is most visible usually in the thick ofa bull run, when new investors who have been late to the party invest at thedrop of a hat, without any research and analysis. Everyone seems to be in ahurry to make gains. The whole country seems to be in the grip of buying onimpulse, helped in a large effect by the increased usage of smartphones. Manyinvestors click 'buy' on stocks as if they shop for clothes or household items.We need to guard ourselves against such behaviour.
