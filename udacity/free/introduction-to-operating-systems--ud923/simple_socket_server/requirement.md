###Simple Socket: Server

Write a simple C program that creates and initializes a server socket. Once initialized, the server should accept a client connection, close the connection, and then exit.

You should provide a way to specify the server's listening port. This can be hardcoded or passed via the command line.

Here are some example clients you may use for testing the server:

[example client 2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud923/resources/ud923-ps1-simple-socket-client-exe.zip) (executable, compiled with gcc on Mac)
