Notes and code for the [linear algebra refresher course on Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud953).



Covers:

- [Vectors](vectors)
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Scalar multiplication
  - Magnitude (length)
  - Direction
  - Dot products
  - Inner products (difference in angle)
  - Parallel & orthogonal vectors
  - Vector projections
  - Cross products
- [Intersections](intersections)
  - WIP

To play with the `Vector` module, run `python -i vectors/vector.py` -- you'll now have the class available in the REPL. To run unit tests, run `python tests` or (if you've made the file executable) just `./tests`.
