# [Building A Search Engine] (http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs101/)

====================================

## Web Crawler

To building a search engine, you need to have a good and fun corpus to start with (in case of Google, the WWW)

To build a crawler:

- You need to find a way to start from a seed page
- Extract the links from that page
- Follow the links 
- Extract the links from those pages
- Repeat

## Programming

A program tells the computer what to do. Computer is an universal machine that can be programmed to do anything. A program must be a very percise sequence of steps.

### Quiz

**What is the goal of Unit 1?**

- (a) Get started with programming
- (b) Learn some important computer science concepts
- (c) Write code to extract a link from web pages
- (d) To rank web pages

**Answer:** (a), (b) & (c)


**What is a programming language**

- (a) A language designed to be executed by computers
- (b) A language designed for describing programs
- (c) A language designed to be written by humans, and executed by computers
- (d) A language designed to be read my humans and written by computers
- (e) A language designed to be read and written by humans, and exeuted by computers

**Answer:** (a), (b), (c), (d) & (e)


### Programming Quiz

**Write a python program that prints out the number of minutes in seven weeks**

```python
print 7*7*24*60      # output 70560
```

## Would You Rather

Why do we need to invent new languages like Python to program computers, rather than using natural languages like English or Mandarin?

### Ambiguity

- Different people can interpret it in different ways
- When we want the computer to interpret it, we need to be sure that it does the same everytime

Examples of ambiguity:

**Would you rather be paid $100 weekly or biweekly?**

- Prefer to be paid $100 weekly
- Prefer to be paid $100 biweekly
- It depends
- Prefer not to be paid at all

**Answer:** It depends


### Verbose

- In order to describle exactly what needs to be done, it would require a huge amount of text


## Grammar Rules


**You can make a sentence by combining a subject, a verb and an object**
```
Sentence -> Subject Verb Object
```

**Where**
```
Subject  ->  Noun
Object   ->  Noun
Verb     ->  any verb
```

This form of interpretation is called **Backus-Naur Form**

## Backus-Naur Form (BNF Grammar)

Each rule has the form

```
<Non Terminal>   ->  Replacement
```

We keep on replacing non terminals with their replacements until you run out of non terminals. This froms a sentence.

Example:

```
        Sentence
     /     |      \
Subject   Verb    Object
  |        |        |
Noun      Verb    Object
  |        |        |
  I       Like    Python
```

This end term is referred as *derivation*


**Which of theses sentences can be produced from this grammar, starting from Sentence**

- (a) Python Eat Cookies
- (b) Python Eat Python
- (c) I Like Eat

**Answer:** (a) & (b)



### Programming Quiz

**Write a python program to print how far light travels in centimeters in one nanosecond**

- Speed of light : 299792458 m/s
- meter : 100 cm
- nanosecond = 1/1000000000 s

```python
speed_of_light = 299792458   # meters per second
meter = 100                  # one meter is 100 centimeters
nanosecond = 1.0/1000000000  # one billionth of a second

print speed_of_light * meter * nanosecond
```

**Given the variables defined here, write Python code that prints out the distance, in meters, that light travels in one processor cycle**

```python
speed_of_light = 299792458.0
cycles_per_second = 2700000000.0

print speed_of_light/cycles_per_second
```


**What is teh value of hours after running this code?**

```python
hours = 9
hours = hours +1 
hours = hours * 2
```

**Answer:** 20


**What is teh value of seconds after running this code?**

```python
minutes = minutes +1 
seconds = minutes * 60
```

**Answer:** Error


**Write Python code that defines the variable age to be your age in years, and then print out the number of days you've been alive**

```python
age = 19
print 19*365.25
```

## Strings

## Extracting Links

**Idea:**

Find the beginning of text that starts with `<a href="<url>">...</a>`

### Quiz

**Write Python code that initializes the variable start_link to be the value of the position where the first `<a href=` occurs in a page.**

```python
page = '<div id="top_bin">	<div id="top_content" class="width960">		<div class="udacity float-left">			<a href="/">'
start_link = page.find('<a href=')

print start_link
```

**Write Python code that assigns to the variable url a string that is the value of the first URL that appears in a link tag in the string page**

```python
page ='<div id="top_bin"><div id="top_content" class="width960"><div class="udacity float-left"><a href="http://www.xkcd.com">'

start_link = page.find('<a href=') 
left = page.find('"', start_link) + 1
right = page.find('"', left)

url = page[left:right]
```
