<h1>Udacity</h1>

<p><b>Udacity</b> is a private institution of <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education">higher education founded by</a> <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun">Sebastian Thrun</a>, David Stavens, and Mike Sokolsky with the goal to provide university-level education that is "both high quality and low cost".
It is the outgrowth of a free computer science class offered in 2011 through Stanford University. Currently, Udacity is working on its second course on building a search engine. Udacity was announced at the 2012 <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Life_Design">Digital Life Design</a> conference.</p>

## Python Programming 1

### **Write Python code that prints out the number of hours in 7 weeks.**

```python
hoursInADay = 24
hoursInAWeek = hoursInADay * 7
hoursIn7Weeks = hoursInAWeek * 7

print hoursIn7Weeks
```

## Python Programming 2


### **Which of the following sequences of statments leaves the value of the variable `x` the same as it was before the statements. Assume that both `a` and `x` refer to integer values before this code**

- (a)
	```
	a = x
	a = a + 1
	```
- (b)
	```
	x = x + 1 
	x = x
	```
- (c)
	```
	z = x
	a = z
	x = a
	```
- (d)
	```
	a = x
	x = a
	```
- (e)
	```
	a,x = x,a
	a,x = x,a
	```

**Answer:** (a), (c), (d) & (e)


## Speed of light

### **Write Python code that stores the distance in meters that light travels in one nanosecond in the variable, nanodistance.**

```python
#These variables are defined for you:
speed_of_light = 299800000. #meters per second
nano_per_sec = 1000000000. #1 Billion

#After your code,running
#print nanodistance
#should output 0.2998

#Note that nanodistance must be a decimal number.

#ASSIGN nanodistance HERE
nanodistance = speed_of_light/nano_per_sec

print nanodistance
```

## Strings

### **Given any string `s`, which of the following always have the same value as `s`? (Be careful, `s` could be `''`)**

- `('a'+s)[1:]`
- `s + ''`
- `s[0] + s[1:]`
- `s[0:]`

**Answer:** (a), (b) & (d)




## Bodacious Udacity

### **Write Python code that prints out `udacious` without using any quote characters in your code.**

```python
s = 'udacity'
t = 'bodacious'

print s[:3] + t[4:]
```

## Find 1

### **Assume text is a variable that holds a string. Write Python code that prints out the position of the first occurrence of 'hoo' in the value of text, or -1 if it does not occur at all.**

```python
text = "first hoo" 
print text.find('hoo')
```


## Find 2

### **Assume text is a variable that holds a string. Write Python code that prints out the position of the second occurrence of `'zip'` in text, or `-1` if it does not occur at least twice.**

```python
# For example,
#   text = 'all zip files are zipped' -> 18
#   text = 'all zip files are compressed' -> -1

text = "all zip files are zipped" 
first = text.find('zip')
second = text.find('zip', first+1)

print second
```

## Rounding Numbers

### **Given a variable, `x`, that stores the value of any decimal number, write Python code that prints out the nearest whole number to `x`.**

```python
#You can assume x is not negative.

# x = 3.14159 -> 3 (not 3.0)
# x = 27.63 -> 28 (not 28.0)

x = 3.14159
toString   = str(x)
getInt     = toString[:toString.find('.')]
firstValue = toString[toString.find('.')+1]

if firstValue >= '5':
    toAdd = '1'
else:
    toAdd = '0'

rounded = int(getInt) + int(toAdd)

print rounded
```
