# [Building A Search Engine] (http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs101/)

====================================

## Web Crawler

### Procedural Abstraction

Write a code many times, and change a parameter to do it over again


```
def <name>(<parameters>):
    <block>
```

### Quiz

```python
start_link  = page.find('<a href=')
start_quote = page.find('"', start_link)
end_quote   = page.find('"', start_quote + 1)
url         = page[start_quote + 1:end_quote]
```


**What are the inputs for the procedure, `get_next_target` ?**

- (a) A number giving position of start of link
- (b) A number giving position of start of next quote
- (c) A string giving contents of the rest of the web page
- (d) A number giving position of start of link and a string giving page content

**Answer:** (c)


**What should be the outputs of `get_next_target`?**

- (a) A string giving the value of the next target `url`
- (b) `url`, `page`
- (c) `url`, `end_quote`
- (d) `url`, `start_lin`

**Answer:** (c)


### Putting it all together

```python
def get_next_target(s):
    
    start_link  = s.find('<a href=')
    start_quote = s.find('"', start_link)
    end_quote   = s.find('"', start_quote + 1)
    url         = s[start_quote + 1:end_quote]

    return url, endquote
```


## Using Procedures

```
<procedure>(<input>, <input1>, ...)
              ^         ^
              |         |
           operands or arguments 
```

```python
def rest_of_string(s):
    return s[1:]

print rest_of_string('audacity')
```


**What does the `inc` prodecure defined below do?**

```python
def inc(n):
    return n + 1
```

- (a) Nothing
- (b) Takes a number as input, and outputs that number plus one
- (c) Takes a number as input, and outputs the same number
- (d) Takes two numbers as inputs, and ouputs their sum

**Answer:** (b)


**What does the `sum` procedure do?**

```python
def sum(a,b):
    a = a + b
```

- (a) Nothing
- (b) Takes two numbers as its inputs, and outputs their sum
- (c) Takes two strings as its inputs, and outputs the concatenation of the two strings
- (d) Takes two numbers as its inputs and changes the value of the first input to be the sum of the two numbers

**Answer:** (a)


### Putting it together

```python
def sum(a,b):
    a = a + b
    return a
```


### Quiz

**Define a procedue, `square` that takes one number as its input, and ouputs the square of that number**


```python
def square(n):
    return n*n
```


### Quiz

**Define a procedure, sum3, that takes three inputs, and outputs the sum of the three input numbers.**

```python
def sum3(a, b, c):
    return a + b + c
```

### Quiz

**Define a procedure, abbaize, that takes two strings as its inputs, and outputs a string that is the first input, followed by two repetitions of the second input, followed by the first input.**

```python
#abbaize('a','b') => 'abba'
#abbaize('dog','cat') => 'dogcatcatdog'

def abbaize(s1, s2):
    return s1 + s2 + s2 + s1
```


### Quiz


**Define a procedure, find_second, that takes two strings as its inputs: a search string and a target string. It should output a number that is the position of the second occurence of the target string in the search string.**


```python
#danton = "De l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace"
#print find_second(danton, 'audace') => 25

def find_second(source, string):
    first = source.find(string)
    second = source.find(string, first+1)
    return second
```


## Making Decisions

### Comparison Operators

Output of a comparison is a boolean value

### Quiz

**Why is the equality comparison done using `==` instead of `=`?**

- (a) Because `=` means approximately equal
- (b) Because not equal uses two characters
- (c) Because Guido really likes `=` signs
- (d) Because `=` means assignment
- (e) It doesn't matter, we can use either

**Answer:** (d)


## If Statements

### Quiz

**Define a procedure, bigger, that takes in two numbers as inputs, and outputs the greater of the two inputs.**

```python
def bigger(a, b):
    return a if a > b else b
```

### Quiz

**Define a procedure, is_friend, that takes a string as its input, and outputs a Boolean indicating if the input string is the name of a friend. Assume I am friends with everyone whose name starts with D and no one else.***


```python
def is_friend(name):
    return name[0] == 'D'
```


### Quiz

**Define a procedure, is_friend, that takes a string as its input, and outputs a Boolean indicating if the input string is the name of a friend. Assume I am friends with everyone whose name starts with D or N.**

```python
def is_friend(name):
    if name[0] == 'D' or name[0] == 'N':
        return True
    return False
```

### Quiz

**Define a procedure, biggest, that takes three numbers as inputs and returns the largest of those three numbers.**

```python
def biggest(a, b, c):
    if a > b and a > c:
        return a
    if b > a and b > c:
        return b
    if c > a and c > b:
        return c
```

    url = page[start_quote + 1:end_quote]
    return url, end_quote
```


## Print All The Links

    start_quote = page.find('"', start_link)
    end_quote = page.find('"', start_quote + 1)
    url = page[start_quote + 1:end_quote]
    
    return url, end_quote

def print_all_links():
    while True:
        url, endpos = get_next_target(page)
        if url:
            print url
            page = page[endpos:]
        else:
            break
```
