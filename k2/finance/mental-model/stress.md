This isthe tendency where an adrenaline rush produces a quicker and more extremereaction. Less stress can improve performance but heavy stress often leads todysfunction.

Dictionarymeaning of stress is: a state of mental or emotional strain or tensionresulting from adverse or very demanding circumstances.

Heavy stress can take a toll on anyone's correct frame of mind. SaysMunger, 'Few people know more about really heavy stress than that it can causedepression. For instance, most people know that an 'acute stress depression'makes thinking dysfunctional because it causes an extreme of pessimism, oftenextended in length and usually accompanied by activity-stopping fatigue.Fortunately, as most people also know, such a depression is one of mankind'smore reversible ailments. Even before modern drugs were available, many peopleafflicted by depression, such as Winston Churchill and Samuel Johnson, gainedgreat achievement in life.'

 

Is stress good for us?

Inthe book [Think Twice: Harnessing the Power of Counter Intuition](http://www.amazon.com/Think-Twice-Harnessing-Power-Counterintuition/dp/1422187381) – Michael Mauboussin writes

Stress is often very helpful. The classic stress response mobilizesenergy to your muscles by increasing your heart rate, blood pressure, andbreathing. High stress also helps your sensory system. For example, policemenreport that during shootouts their visual acuity and focus improves, they sensea slowdown in time, and they fail to hear sounds. For a short burst, the mindcan focus intently on the task at handle. This reaction is valuable inextraordinary circumstances.

In [Psychology of Human Misjudgment](http://law.indiana.edu/instruction/profession/doc/16_1.pdf) –Charlie Munger tells that light stress can slightly improve performance. Westudy very hard before the exams. During this time our body and mind will beunder stress. But this is good as we learn a lot in a very short period oftime. Once the exams are over our body and mind is back to normal.

Constant stress is bad

Stressis bad if it is constant. Imagine yourself going back 150,000 years. Youare standing in the jungle. A cheetah is approaching towards you at full speed.What do you do? The sudden stress in your system will cause an adrenaline rushwhich will make you to run without thinking. In the book [Think Twice: Harnessing the Power of Counter Intuition](http://www.amazon.com/Think-Twice-Harnessing-Power-Counterintuition/dp/1422187381) – MichaelMauboussin writes

An important feature of stress response is that it turns offlong-term systems. You need not worry about your digestion, growth, diseaseprevention, or reproduction if you are about to be a lion’s lunch.

Thismakes sense as you are in the survival mode. As soon as we escape from thecheetah, our systems will be back to normal.

Whathappens if you are in this mode all the times. It will result in a disaster.Most of us are in this mode all the times. We take mortgage which we cannotafford. We pray that we get paycheck every month. We worry about getting laidoff and not being able to pay the mortgage. This is constant stress and it isvery dangerous to our health. In the book [Seeking Wisdom](http://www.amazon.com/Seeking-Wisdom-Darwin-Munger-Edition/dp/1578644283) – Peter Bevelin writes

Long-term stress exposure upsets the brain’s chemical balance.Stress may cause high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, back and stomachproblems, headache, and depression. Studies show that when we feel stress theconcentration of cortisol rises in the bloodstream. One effect of cortisol isto suppress the working of immune system. This makes us more vulnerable todiseases. Stress also counteracts the production of insulin (the hormone thatprocesses blood sugar), causing the process of repair to slow down. Studiesshow that emotional stress creates longer recovery times in our bodies and maybe more harmful to our health than non-emotional stress events like physicalexercise.

Is it worth it?

Constantstress is not good to our body and the mind. It is not worth it even if it hasa huge upside. Why? The downside is not reversible. It is like playing the [Russianroulette](https://janav.wordpress.com/2013/03/24/probability/). Warren Buffett tells

I have no stress whatsoever – zero. I get to do what I love to do every day. I’m surrounded by people that are terrific.

Take upwork that you love to do in life. Learn as much as possible. Spend less thanwhat you earn. Do not take life too seriously.

You can’t change the cards life has dealt you, but you can determinethe way you’ll play them. – TyBoyd

Stress in Life

Oftenfound in: Instances of heavy stress when the mind ceases to work normally.

TheRussian scientist Pavlov spent the last years of his life studying stress andits working on dogs that were previously conditioned to different responses.Pavlov's work is an eye-opener on how stress works its way. Munger says, 'Whathappened to cause Pavlov's last work was especially interesting. During thegreat Leningrad Flood of the 1920s, Pavlov had many dogs in cages. Their habitshad been transformed by a combination of his 'Pavlovian conditioning' plusstandard reward responses into distinct and different patterns. As the watersof the flood came up and receded, many dogs reached a point where they hadalmost no airspace between their noses and the tops of their cages. Thissubjected them to maximum stress. Immediately thereafter, Pavlov noticed thatmany of the dogs were no longer behaving as they had. The dog that formerly hadliked his trainer now disliked him, for example. This result reminds one ofmodern cognition reversals in which a person's love of his parents suddenlybecomes hate, as new love has been shifted suddenly to a cult. Theunanticipated, extreme changes in Pavlov's dogs would have driven any goodexperimental scientist into a near-frenzy of curiosity. That was indeedPavlov's reaction. But not many scientists would have done what Pavlov nextdid. And that was to spend the rest of his long life giving stress-inducednervous breakdowns to dogs, after which he would try to reverse the breakdowns,all the while keeping careful experimental records. He found (1) that he couldclassify dogs so as to predict how easily a particular dog would breakdown; (2)that the dogs hardest to breakdown were also the hardest to return to theirpre-breakdown state; (3) that any dog could be broken down; and (4) that hecouldn't reverse a breakdown except by reimposing stress

Stress in Investing

Ininvesting: It is obvious that investing under stress of outperforming, say themarkets or a competitor, opens the field up for mistakes. Even the stress ofmaintaining past performance for fund mangers can take its toll and hamperjudgement. The stress of recovering a loss made in one stock to find anotherthat can more than compensate can similarly affect judgement.

Prof.Sanjay Bakshi quantifies stress when investing. Here is a good article by himon - [Returns Per Unit of Stress](http://k2invest.blogspot.in/2016/01/returns-per-unit-of-stress.html).
