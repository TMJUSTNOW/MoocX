Readaloud quickly what you see in the image below. Do it twice.

Now,read the same words carefully, and you know the mistakes you missed! This issimply because your reflexive brain jumps to conclusions very easily and thusit is prone to errors.

 

So whatreally happened?

Readingis pretty much an effortless activity (as far as understanding the literalmeaning of the sentence is concerned) which is done by System 1. So in a hurryto make sense of the things, System 1 does these optimizations on its own leveland hence these small inconsistencies remain invisible to us because ofshortcuts taken by System 1.

You maysay that it was a case of an optical illusion, so here’s another example whichdoesn’t involve any images. This is a very simple math problem. Instead oftrying to solve it, just observe the first intuitive answer that comes to yourmind because that will give you a clue to workings of System 1.

The total cost of Bat and a Ball is 110 rupees.

The cost of Bat is 100 rupees more than the Ball.

How much does the Ball cost?

Ifyou’re in a hurry you would quickly conclude that “the ball costs 10 rupees”which is a wrong answer. If you do the math little slowly (using System 2),you’ll realize that the right answer is – ball costs 5 rupees and the bat costs105 rupees.

 

 

Thereason why people get it wrong is because they “jump to conclusions” using thereflexive parts of theirbrains. 

Yousee, our thinking is made up of two parts: (1). Reflexive, and (2). Reflective.

 

Kahnemancalls them System 1 and System 2 thinking respectively in his amazing book [Thinking, Fast and Slow](http://bit.ly/193jrfc).

 

The“reflexive” brain is automatic, fast and effortless, while thereflective brain is the effortful one. It depends on the allocationof attention. It’s what we are paying attention to, mostly. It’s involved incalculations. It’s involved in difficult decisions. It’s involved incontrolling yourself and not telling somebody to go to hell.

 

Reflexive Brain is effortless, automatic,fast, but can lend itself to errors. Its also the reason why you are alivetoday. Your ancestors, who learnt to run away at the ﬁrst sign of danger, wereable to increase their chances of survival until at least they pro-created. Ifeven one of your ancestors had died before pro-creating, you won’t be heretoday. But you are. Reﬂexive brain is VERY useful. But it also leads tomistake. Human Evolution hasn’t kept pace with rapid change sinceindustrialization.

 

Reﬂective Brain is effortful, reasoned, slow,logical, and less prone to error

 

Fastthinking is most of the way that we think. It’s what your memory delivers toyou. 

So whenyou start talking, you just talk. You are not generally conscious about oneword and then the other. In the same way, when you start walking, you walk. Youdon’t analyze your walking abilities and decide to put one foot in front of theother. It happens fast, and automatically.

Infact, most of what we do in life comes automatically. Whether we do somethingskilled or something emotional, most of that is automatic. There’s just anawful lot of automatic stuff that goes on. That’s System 1, as per Kahneman.

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/5DAA5C69-19F0-4143-957D-69405EE7F78D.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PLxbL7kThzQ/Vn5wazRTBbI/AAAAAAAA5WY/1g5qlwip5nQ/s1600/angry_woman.png)

Like,look at this woman’s face on the right.

Yourexperience as you look at the woman’s face seamlessly combines what we normallycall seeing and intuitive thinking.

Assurely and quickly as you saw the face, you knew she is angry. Furthermore,what you saw extended into the future. You sensed that this woman is about tosay some very unkind words, probably in a loud and strident voice.

In allsuch situations you must pay attention, and you will perform less well, ornot at all, if you are not ready or if your attention is directedinappropriately. Use of System 2 requires attention and its operation isdisrupted when the attention is taken away.

 

Thesloppiness of System 1 is what creates cognitive biases. And that makes System1 a very interesting subject of study. The whole field of behaviouraleconomics stems out from the need to understand the peculiar characteristics ofSystem 1. So let’s see how did this dude called System 1 come to be.

 

 

Apremonition of what she was going to do next came to mind automatically andeffortlessly. You did not intend to assess her mood or to anticipate what shemight do, and your reaction to the picture did not have the feel of somethingyou did. It just happened to you.

It wasan instance of fast and intuitive, System 1, thinking.

Imention the word “mother,” “your mother” – you are having an emotion. That’s System 1.

Imention the word “Snake!” – youjump out of fear. That’s System1.

Imention “Prof. Sanjay Bakshi just bought this stock” – you immediately order a few for yourself. That’s System 1.

Imention “I just bought this stock” – you immediately sell it if you already own it. 

 

That’sSystem 1.

So,your System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort andno sense of voluntary control.

Hereare a few examples of the automatic activities that are attributed to System 1and outlined by Kahneman in Thinking,Fast and Slow…

- Detect that one object is     more distant than another. 
- Orient to the source of a     sudden sound. 
- Complete the phrase “bread     and…” 
- Make a “disgust face” when     shown a horrible picture. 
- Detect hostility in a     voice. 
- Answer to 2 + 2 = ? 
- Read words on large     billboards. 
- Drive a car on an empty     road. 
- Find a strong move in chess     (if you are a chess master). 
- Understand simple     sentences. 

Nowanswer this question…

 

19 x 35= ?

This iswhere your System 2 thinking comes into play. If I asked you to solve “2 x 2,”you knew the answer immediately. That’s System 1.

But ifI ask you to solve “19 x 35”, there’s no one answer that comes to your mindintuitively, but a whole set of answers.

Kahnemanwrites…

System 2 is the effortful one. It depends on the allocation ofattention. It’s what we are paying attention to, mostly. It’s involved incalculations. It’s involved in difficult decisions. It’s involved incontrolling yourself and not telling somebody to go to hell. That demandsSystem 2. It’s all part of effortful system.

Hereare a few examples of System 2 thinking…

- Brace for the starter gun     in a race. 
- Focus on the voice of a     particular person in a crowded and noisy room. 
- Look for a woman with white     hair. 
- Search memory to identify a     surprising sound. 
- Maintain a faster walking     speed than is natural for you. 
- Count the occurrences of     the letter ‘a’ in a page of text. 
- Park in a narrow space. 
- Compare two stocks to find     the one with better value. 
- Assess the economics of a     business. 
- Fill out a tax form. 

In allthese situations you must pay attention, and you will perform less well, or notat all, if you are not ready or if your attention is directed inappropriately.

System2 comes into action when System 1 runs into difficulty. It is mobilized when aquestion arises for which System 1 does not offer an answer, as probablyhappened to you when you encountered the multiplication problem 19 × 35.

Relationship between System 1 and System 2

Now,that’s one of the most interesting parts of the discussion on the two systemsof thinking.

Kahnemanwrites in his book…

Systems 1 and 2 are both active whenever we are awake. System 1 runsautomatically and System 2 is normally in a comfortable low-effort mode, inwhich only a fraction of its capacity is engaged.

System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2:impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings.

If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn intobeliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions. When all goes smoothly,which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 withlittle or no modification.

You generally believe your impressions and act on your desires, andthat is fine—usually.

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/01A13D9C-0BD6-5540-BA12-7B857EB7DF38.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LZAKSXAqAg4/Vn5xk6gdZVI/AAAAAAAA5Wk/ih8gj2OkwME/s1600/system1_and_system2_thinking.png)

Insimple terms, if your mind is a movie, System 1 is the lead actor, and System 2the supporting actor. While you may consider System 2 as the more intellectualtypes – because its operations are effortful – as compared to System 1 – whichis automatic and intuitive – it’s important to understand that the former isalso lazy, and is often reluctant to invest more effort than is necessary.

As aconsequence, the thoughts and actions that System 2 believes it has chosen areoften guided by the figure at the center of the story, System 1.

Let megive you two quick examples to explain this…

- While you consider yourself     to have a deep and well-analyzed knowledge (thanks to System 2) about, say     the Kashmir issue, most of what you believe may have been framed by what     you read in papers and watch in media, and thus a product of your feeling     and intuitions (System 1) 
- When you get down to     calculate the intrinsic value of your stock (requires System 2), you may     have already made up your mind on the stock after having read a lot on the     same. Again, your “feelings” and “impressions” (System 1) about the     business may guide you in your intrinsic value calculations. That’s why     Prof. Aswath Damodaran, the leading authority on valuations, says that all     valuations are biased. 

Inother words, in a lot of things, System 1 comes first, and System 2 endorsesand rationalizes. That’s how your mind works.

 

Origins of System 1

TheSystem 1 thinking or the reflexive brain is a gift from evolution. Ourancestors were hunter gatherers and lived in jungles where there was a constantthreat of being eaten by a wild beast. So when they sensed a movement in thebushes it was probably a predator about to jump on them. The only way ourancestors could survive was to run at any such signs.

Thesereflexes or instincts, to run away from a potential danger, created a strongevolutionary advantage for homo sapiens and resulted in the development ofreflexive brain. Imagine if I was in the same situation and upon sensing themovement in the bushes, instead of running, I pulled out my smart phone andstarted googling – “what does noise from bushes mean?” – by the time googlegives me an answer I would be a dead meat.

Now theprocess of evolution is slow. So those instincts which our ancestors developedare still present in us. Our bodies and minds haven’t changed much in last fewthousands years but the environment in which we live in has changeddramatically. The threat of being attacked by a lion isn’t there anymore,unless of course you decide to jump inside the cage of a lion in a zoo.

Many ofthese instincts aren’t very useful in present day. But they do influence of ourdecision making. In the modern world these biases cause us to make big mistakesparticularly in the financial markets.

In Investing

When itcomes to money and investing, presence of System 1 makes our brainsill-equipped to handle the situations. Investing is an area which presents manysituations where reliance on System 1 gets us fooled into making very seriouserrors of judgment.

Manypsychological biases that we have seen in this Latticework series (and manyother which we will cover in future) are brainchild of System 1. Some of themare – Anchoring Effect, Overconfidence Bias, Confirmation Bias, Scarcity Bias,Authority Bias, [Social Proof](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-of-mental-models-social-proof/), Base Rate Neglect, [Liking Bias](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-of-mental-models-liking-bias/) etc.

Anchoringeffect happens when people get hung up on the stock prices instead of thequality of the underlying business. System 1 thinking compares the currentprice to the recent high-low prices (anchor) and jumps to faulty conclusions.

Confirmationbias is that property of System 1 which makes it prone to remain consistentwith its earlier decisions or commitments. System 1 selectively seeks only thatinformation which is consistent to its beliefs and discards anydisconfirming evidence.

When wesee someone dressed as doctor on the TV, we assume that he knows what he’stalking about. Similarly, when a stock market expert (suit-tie wearingtalking heads who like to show off their financial jargon vocabulary)forecasts the market movements and the macroeconomic shifts, System 1falls for the Authority Bias and believes him.

Likingbias makes us prone to favour those whom we like. It’s very common for peopleto get duped into buying useless financial products because the socalled financial advisor (a salesman) comes across as a likeableperson because of his or her pleasant personality andextraordinary communication skills.

Baserate neglect is another such erroneous thinking where System 1 ignores theunderlying base rate of success. If someone claims that his grandfather was achain smoker and lived up to a ripe age of 95, he’s ignoring the statistics.Base rate says that statistically a chain smoker is unlikely to livea long life. Grand father was an exception, an outlier and you can’t make yourdecisions based on such anecdotal evidences. But Systems 1 tends to fall forsuch misleading stats.

Everyoneknows some friend of a friend who made lot of money in an IPO. But don’tforget that the base rate of making money in IPOs is very poor.

Allthese biases of System 1 can wreak havoc and cause serious damage to ourfinancial well being. So how do you fight with System 1?

Stubborn System 1

When Ifirst learnt about System 1, I thought to myself, “Well if System 1 is such atroublemaker, and now that I know its various forms, I should be able to avoidit easily.”

Turnsout that it’s not that easy.

“System1 operates automatically and cannot be turned off at will, errors of intuitivethought are often difficult to prevent.”, writes Kahneman, “Biases cannotalways be avoided, because System 2 may have no clue to the error.”

Butlet’s say you learn to reject the first intuitive response in every situationand call upon System 2 to find the more calculated and rational answer. Wouldthat help? According to Kahneman, it would be an overkill. He writes –

As a way to live your life, however, continuous vigilance is notnecessarily good, and it is certainly impractical. Constantly questioning ourown thinking would be impossibly tedious, and System 2 is much too slow andinefficient to serve as a substitute for System 1 in making routine decisions.The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in whichmistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when thestakes are high.

Noticethe point – when the stakes are high. So when you’re making an investment, it’s a high stake situation.But if you’re buying a toothpaste, you can give System 2 some rest and go withSystem 1.

Conclusion

System1 Vs System 2 is a brilliant mental model to explain the machinery of thought.And when it comes to the subject of thinking, Daniel Kahneman’s book is abible. Let me borrow [Shane Parrish’s words](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2011/11/google-presents-daniel-kahneman/) to give youa sample of what Kahneman’s book holds –

Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fastthinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on ourthoughts and behaviour. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence oncorporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy inthe future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, theprofound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock marketto planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing howthe two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.

Youcan’t call yourself a serious student of behavioural economics if you haven’tread Daniel Kahneman’s book.
