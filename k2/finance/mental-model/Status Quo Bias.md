StatusQuo Bias is also called as Do-NothingSyndrome.

We preferto keep things the way they are. Why?

1. Less or No     effort(physical and mental)
2. Worried by harm that comes     from action than the harm that comes from inaction.

Earlierin the latticework series, I wrote about [Do Something Bias](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-mental-models-do-something-bias/). It’s a cognitive biaswhere people get an urge to take action or make unnecessary decisions when ‘notdoing anything’ is required.

Nowlet’s turn the table, and talk about a bias which is exactly opposite of Do Something Bias.It’s called StatusQuo Bias. The tendency of people where they don’t doanything and continue to maintain the current state of affairs.

If wecould boil down this cognitive bias to a more fundamental body of knowledge, itwould be Physics. I am sure you must have heard of Newton’s laws of motion. Thethird law of motion states –

An object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constantvelocity, unless acted upon by an external force.

Thischaracteristic, called inertia, is exhibited by all physical bodies. And whenit comes to human behaviour, this tendency manifests in the form of Status Quo Bias.

Examples 

Default Settings in smartphone 

Do youown a smartphone? Chances are that you’re reading this on a smartphone or atablet.

One ofthe most interesting thing about these smartphones is that theyallows you to customize everything – data usage, app synchronization, phoneencryption, even how loud you want the camera shutter to sound.

Howmany of these customization settings have you used? In my case – almost none!

AlthoughI’m not technically challenged, but do suffer from, just like most of the otherhuman beings, a cognitive bias.

Organ Donation

Hereis a very intriguing case study which Dan Ariely, author of wildly popular book[Predictably Irrational](http://www.amazon.in/Predictably-Irrational-Hidden-Forces-Decisions/dp/0007368542/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1445849313&sr=8-1&keywords=predictably+irrational&tag=safanive-21), mentions in his [blog post](http://danariely.com/2008/05/05/3-main-lessons-of-psychology/) –

This graph shows the percentage of people, across different Europeancountries, who are willing to donate their organs after they pass away. Whenpeople see this plot and try to speculate about the cause for the differencesbetween the countries that donate a lot (in blue) and the countries that donatelittle (in orange) they usually come up with “big” reasons such as religion,culture, etc.

But you will notice that pairs of similar countries have verydifferent levels of organ donations. For example, take the following pairs ofcountries: Denmark and Sweden; the Netherlands and Belgium; Austria and Germany(and depending on your individual perspective France and the UK). These arecountries that we usually think of as rather similar in terms of culture,religion, etc., yet their levels of organ donations are very different.

So, what could explain these differences? It turns out that it isthe design of the form at the DMV. In countries where the form is set as“opt-in” (check this box if you want to participate in the organ donationprogram) people do not check the box and as a consequence they do not become apart of the program. In countries where the form is set as “opt-out” (checkthis box if you don’t want to participate in the organ donation program) peoplealso do not check the box and are automatically enrolled in the program. Inboth cases large proportions of people simply adopt the default option.

Thisdefault effect caused by StatusQuo Bias on human behaviour is so strong that a wholediscipline of ‘choice architectures design’ has evolved around this ideaof creating intelligent default options in different policy frameworks andvarious human interfacing systems.

Ifyou really want to learn more about choice architecture, [Nudge](http://www.amazon.in/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/0141040017/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1445849520&sr=8-1&keywords=Nudge&tag=safanive-21) by Richard Thaler is an excellentbook to read. Thaler writes …

People have a more general tendency to stick with their currentsituation… [It] has been demonstrated in numerous situations. Most teachersknow that students tend to sit in the same seats in class, even without aseating chart. But status quo bias can occur even when the stakes are muchlarger, and it can get us into a lot of trouble.

…Those who are in charge of circulation [magazine subscriptionsbusiness] know that when renewal is automatic, and when people have to make aphone call to cancel, the likelihood of renewal is much higher than it is whenpeople have to indicate that they actually want to continue to receive themagazine.

So nexttime when you apply for a new credit card and later figure out that you havebeen enrolled for couple of unnecessary “premium services” (which you of coursedon’t remember opting for), then don’t be surprised because the credit cardapplication form probably had those options selected by default and you wereactually required to specifically opt out of them.

Anintelligent but manipulative practice. These very dubious tactics makes me feelthat the credit card industry is largely evil.

Inhis awesome book SeekingWisdom, Peter Bevelin writes…

We prefer to keep things the way they are. We resist change andprefer effort minimization. We favour routine behaviour over innovativebehaviour.

The more emotional a decision is or the more choices we have, themore we prefer the status quo. This is why we stick with our old jobs, brand ofcar, etc. Even in cases where the costs of switching are very low.

…We are more bothered by harm that comes from action than harm thatcomes from inaction. We feel worse when we fail as a result of taking actionthan when we fail from doing nothing.

We prefer the default option, i.e., the alternative that is selectedautomatically unless we change it.

Of coursepeople don’t blindly go with the current status. It’s only when they areeither confused about the options or there is an uncertainty with a decision,that they choose to stick with the current state of affairs.

ShaneParrish, in his wonderful blog Farnam Street,  writes …

What happens when people are presented with difficult choices and noobvious right answer? We tend to prefer making not decision at all-that is, wechoose the norm.

In high-stakes decisions many options are better than the status-quoand we must make trade-offs. Yet, when faced with decisions that involvelife-and-death trade-offs, people frequently remark “I’d rather not think aboutit.”

In otherwords, when faced with a complex decision, people tend to accept the statusquo, as reflected in the old adage, “When in doubt, do nothing.”

What’sthe reason behind this cognitive bias?

Behaviouralscientists believe that Loss Aversion Bias could be the culprit here. Any kindof change in the status quo brings the possibility of disruption in yourcomfort zone.

“Thepresent may stink, but I still don’t want to lose it,” This is how we comfortourselves when we face a need to change.

In Investing

Severalinvestors fall in love with their stocks in the garb of “buy and hold”. So theytend to protect the status quo by inventing new reasons to hold onto a dudinvestment. They will remain stuck in a status quo mode because they hate toadmit they’ve lost money.

Talkingabout status quo bias in the context of making the most efficient use ofcapital, Warren Buffett writes …

We are free of historical biases created by lifelong associationwith a given industry and are not subject to pressures from colleagues having avested interest in maintaining status quo. That’s important: If horses hadcontrolled investment decisions, there would be no auto industry.

Benefits of Status Quo

I mighthave created a very negative picture about Status Quo Bias. It isn’t that badeither. It’s something which mother nature and evolution has ingrained in ourpsyche so it must have some purpose after all. There are some upsides to thisbias too.

Thenoted psychologist, nobel laureate and the father of behaviour economics,Daniel Kahneman, writes in his book [Thinking Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.in/Thinking-Fast-Penguin-Press-Non-Fiction/dp/0141033576/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1445850068&sr=8-1&keywords=Thinking+Fast+and+Slow&tag=safanive-21) …

Loss aversion is a powerful conservative force that favours minimalchanges from the status quo in the lives of both institutions and individuals.This conservatism helps keep us stable in our neighborhood, our marriage, andour job; it is the gravitational force that holds our life together near thereference point.

NassimTaleb, in his book [Antifragile](http://www.amazon.in/Antifragile-Things-that-Gain-Disorder/dp/0141038225/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1445850092&sr=8-1&keywords=antifragile&tag=safanive-21), argues that Status Quo biashas been made to look unnecessarily bad and it can coexist with Do SomethingsBias. He writes …

Few understand that procrastination[possibly caused by Status QuoBias] is our natural defence…I use procrastination as a message from my innerself and my deep evolutionary past to resist interventionism[do something bias]in my writing. Yet some psychologists and behavioural economists seem to thinkthat procrastination is a disease to be remedied and cured.

Psychologists document the opposite of interventionism, calling itthe status quo bias. But it seems that the two can co-exist, interventionismand procrastination, in one’s profession (where one is supposed to dosomething) and in one’s personal life (the opposite). It depends on domain. Itis a sociological and economic problem, one linked to norms and incentivesrather than mental property.

One ofthe ways in which Status Quo can be exploited for your benefit is to start aninvestment SIP. The reason SIP works is because once it’s setup people aren’twilling to take the pain of changing or stopping the SIP.

Don’t Let Status Quo Kill Your dreams

Statusquo bias holds a lot of relevance in how we live our lives. Most of us born ina middle-class family, and with protective parents, must have heard andexperienced endless stories of the dangers of being curious, standing up,standing out or breaking the tradition.

Believeit or not, this bias manifests in minor things like taking the same drivingroute, shopping from the same old store, using the same old brands coffee,soap, toothpastes and washing powder. Deliberately building habits andconsciously creating routines is a nice hack to simplify life and focus onimportant things but please understand that following a set patternunconsciously could ruin the possibility of a promising future.

Settlingfor the status quo is living for something less than God desires for us. It’snot the way you make your dreams come true. The defender of the status quoappeals to the known against the unknown, to the bird in the hand against thebird in the bush, to present possessions against future dreams, to establishedprecedent and well-tried methods against all kinds of dangerous innovations.

“Dreamershave no respect for the status quo.” says Steve Jobs in this famous ad byApple…

May beit’s the time to question your assumptions about career, work, money andrelationships. I hope you’re not running your life on autopilot mode.

“Only one thing would be worse than the status quo.And that would be for the status quo to become the norm.” – ElizabethDole, 1999 campaign speech

Conclusion

Rememberthat deciding to do nothing is also a decision. And the cost of doing nothingcould be greater than the cost of taking an action.

So how doyou overcome Status Quo Bias?

One trickis to periodically revisit your processes and ask whether they are servingtheir purpose.

The 19thCentury British biologist Thomas Henry Huxley said:

Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability tomake yourself do the thing you have to do when it ought to be done whether youlike it or not. It is the first lesson that ought to be learned and howeverearly a person’s training begins, it is probably the last lesson a personlearns thoroughly.

Take careand keep learning.
