Intensecommitment for religious, political or philosophical ideas create anideological bias. Charlie Munger gave a commencement [speech](http://www.valueinvestingworld.com/2007/05/charlie-munger-usc-law-school.html) at USC law school in 2007. In thespeech he recommends avoiding ideological bias completely. Why? Intenseideology will ruin our mind. Excerpt from the speech

Another thing to avoid is extremely intense ideology because itcabbages up one’s mind. You see a lot of it in the worst of the TV preachers.They have different, intense, inconsistent ideas about technical theology, anda lot of them have minds reduced to cabbage. And that can happen with politicalideology. And if you’re young, it’s particularly easy to drift into intense andfoolish political ideology and never get out. When you announce that you’re aloyal member of some cult-like group and you start shouting out the orthodoxideology, what you’re doing is pounding it in, pounding it in. You’re ruiningyour mind, sometimes with starling speed. So you want to be careful withintense ideology. It presents a big danger for the only mind you’re ever goingto have.

Here isthe video of the speech. Ideology part starts from 4:06 minutes

Examples of intense ideologies

Heavyideology is one of the most extreme distorters of human cognition. From thebook [Seeking Wisdom](http://www.amazon.com/Seeking-Wisdom-Darwin-Munger-Edition/dp/1578644283)

Charlie Munger tells us about the danger of ideology: Look at theseIslamic Fundamentalists who just gunned down a bunch of Greek touristsshouting, “God’s work!”

Ideologyis a form of [commitment and consistency](https://janav.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/commitment-and-consistency/). Once youpound it in your head it is very hard to get away with that. You will alwayslooks for evidence that favors your ideology. If you come across adisconfirming evidence you get into cognitive dissonance. Wikipedia definescognitive dissonance as

In psychology, cognitive dissonance is the discomfort experiencedwhen simultaneously holding two or more conflicting cognitions: ideas, beliefs,values or emotional reactions.

Youcannot be in this state for a very long time. You resolve it by dismissing thedisconfirming evidence. Thus you will hold your ideology forever. In the book [Mistakes Were Made](http://www.amazon.com/Mistakes-Were-Made-But-Not/dp/0156033909) the authordiscusses about an experiment conducted on capital punishment (death penalty).

In one experiment, researchers selected people who either favored oropposed capital punishment and asked them to read two scholarly, welldocumented articles on the emotionally charged issue of whether the deathpenalty deters violent crimes. One article concluded that it did; the otherthat it didn’t. If the readers were processing information rationally, theywould at least realize that the issue is more complex than they had previouslybelieved and would therefore move a bit closer to each other in their beliefsabout capital punishment as a deterrence. But dissonance theory predicts thatthe readers would find a way to distort the two articles. They would findreasons to clasp the confirming article to their bosoms, hailing it as a highlycompetent piece of work. And they would be supercritical of the disconfirmingarticle, finding minor flaws and magnifying them into major reasons why theyneed not be influenced by it.

Tetanus,or lockjaw is a serious infection caused by a bacteria which produce a toxinthat affects the brain and nervous system. The toxin leads to stiffness in thejaw muscles as well as other muscles. During the epidemic, the Sudanesevillagers of Nuer And Dinka Tribes, begun extracting the front tooth of alltheir children, so that if they get tetanus later, the adults would be able tofeed the children with liquids. With the help of tetanus vaccine the number ofincidents have come down drastically. But still the villagers keep removing theteeth. Excerpt from the book [Mistakes Were Made](http://www.amazon.com/Mistakes-Were-Made-But-Not/dp/0156033909)

But this is a painful thing to do to children, especially since onlysome would become afflicted. To further justify their actions, to themselvesand their children, the villagers would need to bolster the decision by addingbenefits to the procedure after the fact. For example, they might convincethemselves that pulling teeth has aesthetic value – say, that sunken-chin lookis really quite attractive – and they might even turn the surgical ordeal intoa rite of passage into adulthood. And, indeed, that is just what happened. “Thetoothless look is beautiful,” the villagers say. “People who have all theirteeth are ugly: They look like cannibals who would eat a person. A full set ofteeth makes a man look like a donkey.”

Warren Buffett avoids ideology

CharlieMunger tells that

Warren adored his father – who was a wonderful man. But he was a very heavy ideologue, (rightwing, it happened to be), who hung around with other very heavy ideologues,(right wing, naturally). Warren observed this as a kid. And he decided thatideology was dangerous – and that he was going to stay a long way from it. Andhe has throughout his whole life. That has enormously helped the accuracy ofhis cognition.

How to avoid it?

CharlieMunger uses the following technique to keep himself sane and not drift towardsextreme ideology.

I have what I call in “iron prescription” that helps me keep sanewhen I drift toward preferring one intense ideology over another. I feel thatI’m not entitled to have an opinion unless I can state the arguments against myposition better than the people who are in opposition. I think that I amqualified to speak only when I’ve reached that state.

Hence itis very important to not have extreme ideologies

The business of not drifting into extreme ideology is very, veryimportant in life. If you want to end up wise, heavy ideology is very likely toprevent that outcome.

Do notbelieve anything blindly and it is better to live with doubt. Learning fromRichard Feynman definitely helps.
