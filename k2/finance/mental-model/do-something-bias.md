Doyou remember Dr. Placebo and Mr. Irrational? They teamed up for our discussionon [Mean Reversion](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-mental-models-mean-reversion/), but kind of disappearedafter that.

AlthoughMr. Irrational did come back for [Contrast Mis-Reaction](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-mental-models-contrast-misreaction-tendency/) but Dr. Placebo,who runs a thriving practice, has been finding it hard to take out time fromhis busy schedule. So this time I made him an irresistible offer. Vishal and Ioffered him a discount on [Value Investing Almanack subscription](http://almanack.safalniveshak.com/),which he just couldn’t refuse.

As far asMr. Irrational is concerned, he’s my buddy, almost like my alter ego. So he hasto come when I ask.

Let’senter Dr. Placebo’s clinic. He has this very interesting quote, uttered byfamous scientist Blaise Pascal, displayed in the patient waiting area –

All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietlyin a room alone.

He hopesthat his waiting patients learn something from this deep thought, but littledoes he realize that more than his patients, he is the one who needs tomeditate over Pascal’s quote.

Bythis time you probably are about to lose your patience. When am I going to stopbeating around the bush and come to the point? Please hang in there and allowme to hold your attention for few more seconds. All that I have said above isquite related to our mental model for today which is – Do Something Bias.

Incase it sounds too simple a name for a mental model, there is another termwhich I learnt from Nassim Taleb and it’s called ‘Naive Intervention’. If that soundstoo jargon-ish then how about ADHD?

ADHD

I am suremany of you know few friends who are so restless that they find it impossibleto sit at one place quietly. They have very short attention span and can’t staywith one activity for long. In medical science this abnormality is known asADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). What medical science doesn’ttell you explicitly that evolution (yeah, the same process which transformedmonkeys into humans) has installed the seeds of ADHD in every human brain.

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/3DEA4902-C154-FF44-901F-27D9B6FB457D.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5zFtrEuLvLI/VnJ-Nw9atYI/AAAAAAAA4xM/xPzrUsSn4NQ/s1600/Snip20150811_70-e1439294951383.png)

A surveyin US revealed that the average holding period of a stock is 22 seconds. Prettyclose to the attention span of a 5 year old.

Now insome cases this tendency is more pronounced and for few, with very severesymptoms of ADHD, may actually need medical treatment but for the rest of usthis disorder manifests very subtly in our day to day decision making.

Inan attempt to be efficient and productive we force ourselves to always staybusy with some task or other. Not being occupied gives the impression that weare incompetent and wasteful. But sometimes, quite often actually, too muchactivity becomes counterproductive. In psychology this flavour of ADHD is knownas Do Something Bias (DSB).

19thCentury American writer Henry David Thoreau said –

It is not enough to be busy; so are the ants. The question is: Whatare we busy about?’ Don’t confuse activity with results. There is no reason todo a good job with something you shouldn’t do in the first place.

DSB isnot only wasteful but can harm you in the long term.

Ironically,even medical profession isn’t immune to the ill effects of DSB. In medicalterms this is called iatrogenics, which means causing unintentional harm while trying to help.

NassimTaleb has extensively discussed this topic in his book [Antifragile](http://amzn.to/19XFXXk). Here is an excerpt from the book –

Consider this need to do-something through an illustrative example.In the 1930s, 389 children were presented to New York City doctors; 174 of themwere recommended tonsillectomies [surgically removing the tonsil, a small bellshaped piece of organ hanging inside your throat]. The remaining 215 childrenwere again presented to doctors, and 99 were said to need the surgery. When theremaining 116 children were shown to yet a third set of doctors, 52 wererecommended the surgery…note that a death occurs in about every 15000 suchoperations … every child who undergoes an unnecessary operation has ashortening of her life expectancy…

When you medicate a child for an imagined or invented psychiatricdisease, say, ADHD or depression, instead of letting him out of the cage, thelong-term harm is largely unaccounted for.

You canroutinely find Dr. Placebo prescribing heavy doses of antibiotics for a minorseasonal cold. Most of these strong antibiotic drugs are hepatotoxic i.e. theyhave harmful effects on liver. In short them they expedite the recovery fromflu but the liver damage isn’t visible immediately.

Whydoesn’t he just send his patients back home with only an instruction to takerest and allow the body’s natural healing system to cure the minor cold? Talebexplains –

…the doctor who refrains from operating on a back (a very expensivesurgery), instead giving it a chance to heal itself, will not be rewarded andjudged as favourably as the doctor who makes the surgery look indispensable,then brings relief to the patient while exposing him to operating risks, whileaccruing great financial rewards to himself.

Obviouslyit’s not just the medical profession which is plagued with DSB. James Montier,in his book [The LittleBook Of Behavioral Investing](http://amzn.to/1f5ygFo), explains theprevalence of this psychological bias in the field of soccer.

Duringpenalty kicks, 94% or the times the goal keepers either dive towards their leftor towards their right. However, if they stay at the center their success rateis far higher. Explanation offered by these goalkeepers was that at least theyfeel they are making an effort when they dive left or right, whereas standingin the center and watching a goal scored to the left or the right of you wouldfeel much worse.

The ideaof DSB originates from the human urge to say “Look what I did for you”than “Look what I avoided for you”. This is closely related to the concept ofsilent evidence that we discussed in the Behaviouronomics section of firstissue of Value Investing Almanack (you don’t need to subscribe to VIA, thefirst issue is freely downloadable).

Myfears came true when I prodded Dr. Placebo little more about this – 

Anshul: Doctor, don’t you knowthat most of these flu cases don’t need medical intervention? And these strongdoses of antibiotics that you prescribe have long term harmful effects.

Dr. Placebo: Yes Anshul,you’re right. But if I don’t prescribe any medicine to my patients they feel Ihaven’t done anything to help them. Why would they pay a hefty fee for doingnothing? Moreover, prescribing these medicines have psychological effect also.Just because they are popping a pill makes them believe that they are gettingbetter. Placebo effect you know! (smiling sheepishly)

Anshul: In that case you couldactually prescribe them placebos. You don’t need to stuff them with toxicdrugs.

Dr. Placebo: People are smartthese days. Even before buying the drug they pull out their smart phones andgoogle about the drug. If they find that I am prescribing them simple placebosthey might stop coming to me or worse they might even file a malpracticelawsuit against me. Can you see my predicament?

Eventhough this is an imagined conversation, Dr. Placebo has a point here. Justlike the Soccer situation, this is a classic lollapalooza created by incentivecaused bias (also called agency problem) and DSB. In case you haven’t heard ofthe term lollapalooza, you must read [Poor Charlie’s Almanack](http://amzn.to/1bXAXnA).

Oneof the culprits for triggering DSB in human mind is the overload ofinformation. Has it ever happened that you opened the front page of the leadingfinancial newspaper and it said “Nothing significant happened today”. For thatmatter majority of news (financial or non-financial) is toxic. You don’tbelieve me? Check out [this article](http://1icz9g2sdfe31jz0lglwdu48.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Avoid_News_Rolf_Dobelli.pdf) by Rolf Dobelli, author ofbestselling book [TheArt of Thinking Clearly](http://amzn.to/13N716K).

In Business and Investing

Let’sturn to the field of finance and see how this behavioural model explainscertain peculiarities present in the markets.

Themarket ups and downs are natural economic cycles (very similar to a livingorganism whose pulse is not a straight line) and it’s the natural way ofmaintaining a dynamic equilibrium (supply and demand). Any human intervention(faulty government policies to bail out failing banks or printing excess money)to iron out these natural cycles only seems to help in the short run. In thelong run these actions actually build up a bigger bubble and results in severedevastating markets crashes.

Any smallfluctuation in the markets/economies creates an urge in policy maker’s mind todo something about it. This itch to DSB (instead of giving market sometime to self-correct itself) creates unintended consequences by blowing up theseverity of original boom and bust cycles.

Shortterm fluctuations in the stock prices is a noise that you are supposed toignore. If you start reacting to every small portfolio fluctuations and churnyour portfolio frequently, in the long run your performance will be poor.

Anotherinteresting property of DSB is that the urge to act tends to intensifyafter a loss (a period of poor portfolio performance). So if your portfoliohasn’t performed well for sometime (short term), it’s very difficult to sit anddo nothing about it. This is when you need to be alert and be aware of yourvulnerability.

Similarly,if you have cash but no opportunity available (a common problem for valueinvestors during bull market), you need to practice patience and remindyourself of ill effects of DSB.

WarrenBuffett says –

Holding cash is uncomfortable, but not as uncomfortable as doingsomething stupid.

This[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZtCQSfC2E) aptly captures the idea –

Makingtoo many decisions also introduces something called decision fatigue. The moredecisions you have to make lower the quality of each decision. Too manydecisions and over activity increase the odds of failure especially in stockmarket investing.

How To Overcome

So how doyou deal with this bias ? The cure for this irrational behaviour is patience.Let’s look at a role model in the field of professional sports (after all weare aiming to become multidisciplinary thinkers) who has successfully overcomethis behavioural bias.

Even ifyou aren’t a big cricket fan you must be familiar with Rahul Dravid and hisbatting style. He is known to be the most patient batsman. Instead of swinginghis bat at every ball he would patiently wait for the right one, a ball whichis well inside his circle of competence (remember those perfectly executedcover drives).

That’swhat made him one of the most consistent batsman in cricket history. Scoring 5double centuries in test cricket isn’t a joke. It won’t be an overstatement ifI say that Dravid’s record is akin to compounding money at 25 percent CAGR for25 years.

So whatdoes it mean for you when it comes to stock market investing? Does it mean thatyou should close your eyes and stop looking for ideas?

Notreally. It definitely doesn’t mean that you should stop [reading annual reports](http://www.safalniveshak.com/category/annual-report-review/).

It meansthat instead of trying to score a six on every ball, if you can patiently waitfor the right stock to appear at the right price, you too can become “the wall”in stock market investing.

I knowsitting on the sidetracks and waiting is very boring but I hope you understandthat investing is a serious game and it’s purpose is not entertainment. Aslegendary investor Seth Klarman puts it:

In a world in which most investors appear interested in figuring outhow to make money every second and chase the idea du jour, there ’s alsosomething validating about the message that it’s okay to do nothing and waitfor opportunities to present themselves or to pay off. That’s lonely andcontrary a lot of the time, but reminding yourself that that ’s what it takesis quite helpful.

What itmeans is that while making any decision or taking any action, you should beaware of your vulnerability for DSB. You should question yourself whether yourdecision is backed by sound reasons and analysis or it is just an excuse tosatisfy the itch to do something.

S.Pulavarti, who manages the $ 1.5 billion UCLA endowment fund says –

I believe in making as few decision as possible. It’s like you arein jungle with a gun which has only 5  bullets. If you are told that thereis tiger in the jungle, you will be very careful about when to pull thetrigger. It’s the same with investments.

Conclusion

Iwill close this discussion with a quote from Warren Buffett –

I could improve your ultimate financial welfare by giving you aticket with only twenty slots in it so that you had twenty punches –representing all the investments that you got to make in a lifetime. And onceyou’d punched through the card, you couldn’t make any more investments at all.Under those rules, you’d really think carefully about what you did, and you’dbe forced to load up on what you’d really thought about. So you’d do so muchbetter.

Take careand keep learning.
