Ourinsensitivity to base rates emanates from the representativeness heuristic andis a common psychological bias.

From[Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767908864/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0767908864&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20):

Donald Jones is either a librarian or a salesman. His personalitycan best be described as retiring. What are the odds that he is a librarian?

When we use this little problem in seminars, the typical responsegoes something like this: “Oh, it’s pretty clear that he’s a librarian. It’smuch more likely that a librarian will be retiring; salesmen usually haveoutgoing personalities. The odds that he’s a librarian must be at least 90percent.” Sounds good, but it’s totally wrong.

The trouble with this logic is that it neglects to consider thatthere are far more salesmen than male librarians. In fact, in the UnitedStates, salesmen outnumber male librarians 100 to 1. Before you even consideredthe fact that Donald Jones is “retiring,” therefore, you should have assignedonly a 1 percent chance that Jones is a librarian. That is the base rate.

Now, consider the characteristic “retiring.” Suppose half of allmale librarians are retiring, whereas only 5 percent of salesmen are. Thatworks out to 10 retiring salesmen for every retiring librarian — making theodds that Jones is a librarian closer to 10 percent than to 90 percent.Ignoring the base rate can lead you wildly astray.

CharlieMunger, instructs us how to think about base rates with an example of anemployee who got caught for stealing, claiming she’s never done it before andwill never do it again:

You find an isolated example of a little old lady in the See’s CandyCompany, one of our subsidiaries, getting into the till. And what does she say?“I never did it before, I’ll never do it again. This is going to ruin my life.Please help me.” And you know her children and her friends, and she’d beenaround 30 years and standing behind the candy counter with swollen ankles. Whenyou’re an old lady it isn’t that glorious a life. And you’re rich and powerfuland there she is: “I never did it before, I’ll never do it again.” Well howlikely is it that she never did it before? If you’re going to catch 10embezzlements a year, what are the chances that any one of them — applying whatTversky and Kahneman called base rate information — will be somebody who onlydid it this once? And the people who have done it before and are going to do itagain, what are they all going to say? Well in the history of the See’s CandyCompany they always say, “I never did it before, and I’m never going to do itagain.” And we cashier them. It would be evil not to, because terrible behaviorspreads ([Greshams law](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2009/12/mental-model-greshams-law/)).

MaxBazerman, in [Judgment in Managerial Decision Making](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470049456/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0470049456&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20),writes:

(Our tendency to ignore base rates) is even stronger when thespecific information is vivid and compelling, as Kahneman and Tverskyillustrated in one study from 1972. Participants were given a brief descriptionof a person who enjoyed puzzles and was both mathematically inclined andintroverted. Some participants were told that this description was selectedfrom a set of seventy engineers and thirty lawyers. Others were told that thedescription came from a list of thirty engineers and seventy lawyers. Next,participants were asked to estimate the probability that the person describedwas an engineer. Even though people admitted that the brief description did notoffer a foolproof means of distinguishing lawyers from engineers, most tendedto believe the description was of an engineer. Their assessments wererelatively impervious to differences in base rates of engineers (70 percentversus 30 percent of the sample group.)

Participants do use base-rate data correctly when no otherinformation is provided. In the absence of a personal description, people usethe base rates sensibly and believe that a person picked at random from a groupmade up mostly of lawyers is most likely to be a lawyer. Thus, peopleunderstand the relevance of base-rate information, but tend to disregard suchdata when individuating data are also available.

Ignoring base rates has many unfortunate implications. … Similarly,unnecessary emotional distress is caused in the divorce process because of thefailure of couples to create prenuptial agreements that facilitate the peacefulresolution of a marriage. The suggestion of a prenuptial agreement is oftenviewed as a sign of bad faith. However, in far too many cases, the failure tocreate prenuptial agreements occurs when individuals approach marriage with thefalse belief that the high base rate for divorce does not apply to them.

Ofcourse, this applies to investing as well. [This conversation](http://www.safalniveshak.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Value-Investing-The-Sanjay-Bakshi-Way-Safal-Niveshak-Special.pdf) with Sanjay Bakshispeaks to this:

One of the great lessons from studying history is to do with “baserates”. “Base rate” is a technical term of describing odds in terms of priorprobabilities. The base rate of having a drunken-driving accident is higherthan those of having accidents in a sober state.

So, what’s the base rate of investing in IPOs? When you buy a stockin an IPO, and if you flip it, you make money if it’s a hot IPO. If it’s not ahot IPO, you lose money. But what’s the base rate – the averaged out experience– the prior probability of the activity of subscribing for IPOs – in the longrun?

If you do that calculation, you’ll find that the base rate of IPOinvesting (in fact, it’s not even investing … it’s speculating) sucks! [T]hat’sthe case, not just in India, but in every market, in different time periods.

When you evaluate whether smoking is good for you or not, if youlook at the average experience of 1,000 smokers and compare them with a 1,000non-smokers, you’ll see what happens.

People don’t do that. They get influenced by individual stories likea smoker who lived till he was 95. Such a smoker will force many people toignore base rates, and to focus on his story, to fool themselves into believingthat smoking can’t be all that bad for them.

What is the base rate of investing in leveraged companies in bullmarkets?

This is what you learn by studying history. You know that the baserate of investing in an airline business sucks. There’s this famous joke abouthow to become a millionaire. You start with a billion, and then you buy anairline. That applies very well in this business. It applies in so many otherbusinesses.

Take the paper industry as an example. Averaged out returns oncapital for paper industry are bad for pretty good reasons. You are selling acommodity. It’s an extremely capital intensive business. There’s a lot ofover-capacity. And if you understand microeconomics, you really are a pricetaker. There’s no pricing power for you. Extreme competition in such anenvironment is going to cause your returns on capital to be below what youwould want to have.

It’s not hard to figure this out (although I took a while to figureit out myself). Look at the track record of paper companies around the world,and the airline companies around the world, or the IPOs around the world, orthe textile companies around the world. Sure, there’ll be exceptions. But weneed to focus on the average experience and not the exceptional ones. Themetaphor I like to use here is that of a pond. You are the fisherman. If youwant to catch a lot of fish, then you must go to a pond where there’s a lot offish. You don’t want to go to fish in a pond where there’s very little fish.You may be a great fisherman, but unless you go to a pond where there’s a lotof fish, you are not going to find a lot of fish.

So one of the great lessons from studying history is to see what hasreally worked well and what has turned out to be a disaster – and to learn fromboth.
