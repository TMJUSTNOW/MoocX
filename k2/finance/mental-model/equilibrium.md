Thereare many ways in which you can visualize the concept of equilibrium, but one ofthe simplest comes from [Boombustology](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470879467/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0470879467) where a ball sits on asimple curved shape.

A situation in which equilibrium is possible is one in which overtime, if left to its own devices, the ball will find one unique location.Overshooting and undershooting this unique location is self-correcting. Asituation of disequilibrium, however, is one in which the ball is unable tofind a unique location. A ball in such a state does not generateself-correcting moves that dampen its moves toward a theoretical “equilibrium”or resting spot; rather, disequilibrium generates motion that is self-reinforcingand accelerates the ball’s move away from any stable state.

Let’stake a step back and thank Netwon.

In[Principia Mathematica](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1178292991/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1178292991) he describes histhree laws of motion. Using planets, these laws allowed Newton to demonstratehow gravitational forces act between two bodies. He showed that the force ofthe sun’s gravity (pulling planets toward the sun) is offset by their forwardvelocity. These two forces, equal in nature, create a state of equilibrium.

Equilibriumis a balance between one or more opposing forces. As you can imagine, differenttypes of equilibrium exist. Static equilibrium is when a system is at rest.Dynamic equilibrium is when two or more forces are equally matched. RobertHagstorm, in the [Last Liberal Art](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231160100/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0231160100), helps illustrate thedifference between the two:

A scale that is equally weighted on both sides is an example ofstatic equilibrium. Fill a bathtub full of water and then turn off the faucetand you will observe static equilibrium. But if you unplug the drain and thenturn on the faucet so the level of the bathtub does not change, you arewitnessing dynamic equilibrium. Another example is the human body. It remainsin dynamic equilibrium so long as the heat loss from cooling remains in balancewith the consumption of sugars.

Supply and Demand + Equilibrium

Therule of supply and demand, from economics, is also an example of the law ofequilibrium.

In 1997Warren Buffett, through his company Berkshire Hathaway, purchased 11.2 millionounces of silver based on his understanding of equilibrium. In his annualletter for that year, he succinctly sums up the investment:

In recent years, bullion inventories have fallen materially, andlast summer Charlie (Munger) and I concluded that a higher price would beneeded to establish equilibrium between supply and demand.

Toolittle supply and equilibrium is out of balance. Buffett (correctly) bet thatthe only way to bring the market back into a state of equilibrium was risingprices. Demand, the balancing force to supply, can also result in successfulinvestments.

In his2011 shareholder letter, Buffett again illustrates the concept of equilibriumthrough supply and demand.

Today the world’s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all ofthis gold were melded together, it would form a cube of about 68 feet per side.(Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At $1,750 per ounce– gold’s price as I write this – its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call thiscube pile A. Let’s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, wecould buy all U.S. cropland (400 million acres with output of about $200billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world’s most profitable company,one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we wouldhave about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feelingstrapped after this buying binge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillionselecting pile A over pile B?

Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold,current prices make today’s annual production of gold command about $160billion. Buyers – whether jewelry and industrial users, frightened individuals,or speculators – must continuallyabsorb this additional supply to merely maintain an equilibrium at present prices.

A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will haveproduced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton, and other crops – and willcontinue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. ExxonMobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to itsowners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, youget 16 Exxons). The 170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and stillincapable of producing anything. You can fondle the cube, but it will notrespond.

Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it’s likelymany will still rush to gold. I’m confident, however, that the $9.6 trillioncurrent valuation of pile A will compound over the century at a rate farinferior to that achieved by pile B.

Inherent in most equilibrium-oriented approaches is a belief thathigher prices generate new supply that tends to push prices down. Likewise, itis believed that lower prices generate new demand that tends to push prices up.In this way, deviations from an appropriate price level are self-correcting.

Agrasp of [supply and demand](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2009/07/mental-model-supply-and-demand/) can help us makebetter investment decisions. The producers of undifferentiated goods, (e.g., analuminium can), are (usually) poor investments because the only way they willmake adequate returns is under conditions of tight supply. If any excess capacityexists in the industry, prices will trend down towards the cost of producing.In this case, owners are left with unsatisfactory returns on their investment.

Theonly real winners are the low cost producers. As prices trend down only theycan maintain full production whereas high cost competitors must cut production,which starts reducing supply and moves the industry towards equilibrium. Whenbusiness picks up again, as it inevitably does, the production that was onceshuttled comes back online. Only low cost producers can operate through thecycle. Opportunities to profit from equilibrium exist when demand outstripscapacity, which usually results from: (1) a positive change in demand or (2) anegative change in supply.

Whileseductively simple, this model of equilibrium in financial markets is somewhatincomplete. We must consider reflexivity.

GeorgeSoros writes, “Reflexivity is, in effect, a two-way feedback mechanism in whichreality helps shape the participants’ thinking and the participants’ thinkinghelps shape reality in an unending process in which thinking and reality maycome to approach each other but can never become identical.”

Theimplications of reflexivity on financial markets are quite profound,particularly with regard to the existence of an equilibrium price. Sorosdescribes these implications in [his own words](http://web.archive.org/web/20151002062731/http:/churchandstate.org.uk/2011/04/george-soros-theory-of-reflexivity-mit-speech/) succinctly:

Instead of a tendency towards some kind of theoretical equilibrium,the participants’ views and actual state of affairs enter into a process ofdynamic disequilibrium, which may be self-reinforcing at first, moving boththinking and reality in a certain direction, but is bound to becomeunsustainable in the long run and engender a move in the opposite direction.

Soros’testimony in 1994 to the House Banking Committee summarizes his theory ofreflexivity and how it manifests itself in financial markets:

I must state at the outset that I am in fundamental disagreementwith the prevailing wisdom. The generally accepted theory is that markets tendtowards equilibrium and on the whole discount the future correctly. I operateusing a different theory, according to which financial markets cannot possiblydiscount the future correctly because they do not merely discount the future,they help to shape it. In certain circumstances, financial markets can affectthe so-called fundamentals which they are supposed to reflect. When thathappens, markets enter into a state of dynamic disequilibrium and behave quitedifferently than what would be considered normal by the theory of efficientmarkets. Such boom/bust sequences do not arise very often, but when they do, theycan be very disruptive, precisely because they affect the fundamentals of theeconomy.

InBoombustology, Mansharamani writes:

… financial extremes are characterized by two primary components: aprevailing trend that exists in reality and a misconception relating to it. Heoften uses real estate as an example to illustrate this point. The prevailingtrend in reality is that there is an increased willingness to lend and acorresponding rise in prices. The misconception relating to this trend is thatthe prices of real estate are independent of the willingness to lend. Further,as more banks become willing to lend, and the number of buyers therefore rises,the prices of real estate rise—thereby making the banks feel more secure (givenhigher collateral values) and driving more lending.

Feedback Loops and Equilibrium

In[Universal Principles of Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592535879/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1592535879), WilliamLidwell & co. write:

Every action creates an equal and opposite reaction. When reactionsloop back to affect themselves, a feedback loop is created. All real-worldsystems are composed of many such interacting feedback loops — animals,machines, businesses, and ecosystems, to name a few. There are two types of feedback loops:positive and negative. Positive feedback amplifies system output, resulting ingrowth or decline. Negative feedback dampers output, stabilizes the systemaround an equilibrium point.

Positive feedback loops are effective for creating change, butgenerally result in negative consequences if not moderated by negative feedbackloops. For example, in response to head and neck injuries in football in thelate 1950s, designers created plastic football helmets with internal padding toreplace leather helmets. The helmets provided more protection, but inducedplayers to take increasingly greater risks when tackling. More head and neckinjuries occurred (after the introduction of plastic helmets) than before. Byconcentrating on the problem in isolation (e.g., not considering changes inplayer behavior designers inadvertently created a positive feedback loop inwhich players used their head and neck in increasingly risky ways. Thisresulted in more injuries which resulted in additional redesigns that made thehelmet shells harder and more padded and so on.

Negative feedback loops are effective for resisting change. Forexample, the Segway Human Transported uses negative feedback lops to maintainequilibrium. As a rider leans forward or backward, the Segway accelerates ordecelerates to keep the system in equilibrium. To achieve this smoothly, theSegway makes hundreds of adjustments every second. Given the high adjustmentrate, the oscillations around the point of equilibrium are so small as to notbe detectable. However, if fewer adjustments were made per second, theoscillations would increase in size and the ride would become increasinglyjerky.

Diseases and Equilibrium

MalcolmGladwell illustrates this in [The Tipping Point](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316346624/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0316346624) with a hypotheticaloutbreak of the flu.

Suppose, for example, that one summer 1,000 tourists come toManhattan from Canada carrying an untreatable strain of twenty-four-hour virus.This strain of flu has a 2 percent infection rate, which is to say that one outof every 50 people who come into close contact with someone carrying it catchesthe bug himself. Let’s say that 50 is also exactly the number of people theaverage Manhattanite — in the course of riding the subways and mingling withcolleagues at work — comes into contact with every day. What we have, then, isa disease in equilibrium. Those 1,000 Canadian tourists pass on the virus to1,000 new people on the day they arrive. And the next day those 1,000 newlyinfected people pass on the virus to another 1,000 people, just as the original1,000 tourists who started the epidemic are returning to health. With thosegetting sick and those getting well so perfectly in balance, the flu chugsalong at a steady but unspectacular clip through the test of summer and fall.

But then comes the Christmas season. The subways and buses get morecrowded with tourists and shoppers, and instead of running into an even 50people a day, the average Manhattanite now has close contact with, say, 55people a day. All of a sudden, the equilibrium is disrupted. The 1,000 flucarriers now run into 55,000 people a day and at a 2 percent infection rate,that translates into 1,100 cases the following day. Those 1,100, in turn, arenow passing on their virus to 55,000 people as well, so that by day three thereare 1,210 Manhattanites with the flu and by day four 1,331 and by the end ofthe week there are nearly 2,000, and so on up, in an exponential spiral untilManhattan has a full-blow flu epidemic on its hands by Christmas Day. That momentwhen the average flu carrier went from running into 50 people a day to runninginto 55 was the Tipping point. It was the point at which an ordinary and stablephenomenon — a low-level flu outbreak — turned into a public health crisis. Ifyou were to draw a graph of the progress of the Canadian flu epidemic, theTipping point would be the point on the graph where is suddenly turned upward.
