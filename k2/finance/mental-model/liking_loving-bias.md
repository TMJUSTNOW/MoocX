Webelieve, trust and agree with people we know and like. We like the peoplewho like us. We like our own ideas. We don’t learn from people we don’tlike and we don’t want to be associated with them. In fact we develop hatredagainst people we don’t like.

Joe Girard

JoeGirard, car salesman, who sold Chevrolets cars. He was the number onesalesman for 12 straight years. Every day he worked, he sold 5 cars and truckson average. He has been called as the greatest car salesman by theGuinness Book of World Records. How did he do this? Excerpt from [Influence](http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X)

For all his success, the formula he employed was surprisinglysimple. It consisted of offering people just two things: a fair price andsomeone they liked to buy from. “And that’s it”, he claimed in an interview.“Finding the salesman they like, plus the price” put them both together, andyou get a deal.

Each month he sent every one of his more than thirteen thousandformer customers a holiday greeting card containing a personal message. Theholiday greeting changed from month to month (Happy New Year or HappyThanksgiving, etc), but the message printed on the face of the card nevervaried. It read, “I like you.”

Role Models

Ifyou want to get better in life it is better to have role models you like. Why?If you admire/like your role model you will start to emulate them. In turn youwill get their qualities. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger benefited fromWarren’s uncle Fred Buffett. Excerpt from the book [Poor Charlie’sAlmanack](http://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/)

One common, beneficial example for us both was Warren’s uncle, FredBuffett, who cheerfully did the endless grocery store work that Warren and Iended up admiring from a safe distance. Even now, after I have known so manyother people, I doubt if it is possible to be a nicer man than Fred Buffettwas, and he change me for the better. There are large social policyimplications in the amazingly good consequences that ordinarily comefrom people likely to trigger extremes of love and admiration boosting eachother in a feedback mode. For instance  it is obviously desirable toattract a lot of lovable, admirable people into theteaching profession.

Thomas Edison dislike for Alternating Current

ThomasEdison was an inventor who had more than 2300+ patents. One of his inventionswas Direct Current(DC). Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor who workedfor Edison. He developed Alternating Current(AC) under Edison’s supervision.Tesla made the following points for AC

1. It can     illuminate light bulbs over greater distances.
2. It could power gigantic     industrial machines using the same electrical grid.

Healso claimed that modern world require AC and he was right as AC could onlyprovide the scale and scope needed for extensive use of electricity. How didEdison react? From The [Upside of Irrationality](http://www.amazon.com/The-Upside-Irrationality-Unexpected-Benefits/dp/B004NSVE50)

As a competitive inventor, Edison was not about to let thefuture of direct current be dictated by chance, so he started a big publicrelations campaign against alternating current, attempting to generate publicfear about the competing technology. He initially demonstrated the dangers ofAC by directing his technicians to electrocute stray cats and dogs, andused this to show the potential risks of alternating current. As his next step,he secretly funded the development of an electric chair based on alternatingcurrent for the purpose of capital punishment. The first person ever to beexecuted in the electric chair, William Kemmler, was slowly cooked alive. NotEdison’s finest moment, to be sure, but it was a very effective and rather frightening demonstrationof the dangers of alternating curent.

IfEdison behaved this way because of liking his own idea how would normal personlike me behave? Watch the explaination given by Dan Ariely - [Chapter 4 - Not inventedhere bias](https://youtu.be/OqQQBSJj5yc).

 

 

Cross Group Disliking’s

[Hindu– Muslims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Gujarat_violence) hatred has been around for several decades. The recent one which Iremember happened in the year 2002 in the state of Gujarat. On 27th February2002, Hindu Pilgrims returning by the Sabarmathi Express train from Ayodhya,were burnt alive in a railway coach. This in turn resulted in attacks againstMuslims and communal riots on a large scaled across the state. In all more than1000+ people got killed.

Israel– Palestinian conflict began inthe early 20th century. Although these 2 groups have different religions,religious differences are not the cause of the conflict. It is a struggle overland.

Theabove two examples shows that grown up Adults are no different than Kids.Muzafer Sherif a social psychologist conducted an experiment with theboys of summer camp. The boys were separated into two residence cabins and itin turn stimulated “We vs They” between the groups. Excerpt from [Influence](http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X)

At this point, it was evident that receipt for disharmony was quickand easy. Just separate the participants into groups and let sit for a while intheir own juices. Then mix together over the flame of continued competition andthere you have it; cross group hatred at a rolling boil

Keep In Mind

1. Benjamin     Franklin wrote, Love your enemies, for they tell your faults.
2. Focus on the point discussed     and not the person who is making it.

Impact of Liking/Loving Bias

Why isthis tendency important to consider? Think of news reports of extreme stepsthat people take, being in love. The effects of the liking/loving tendency aremore profound than they appear. Says Munger, 'One very practical consequence ofthe liking/loving tendency is that it acts as a conditioning device that makesthe liker or lover tend

- (1) to ignore faults of, and     comply with wishes of, the object of his affection, 
- (2) to favor people,     products, and actions merely associated with the object of his affection     and 
- (3) to distort other facts to     facilitate love.'

Often found in: Individuals

In Life:The purest form of love is between a mother and her child. A child is born tolike and love. The tendency to love is not restricted to blood relations. 'Eachchild, will almost surely come to like and love, not only as driven by itssexual nature, but also in social groups not limited to its genetic or adoptive'family.''

Thetendency to love produces another need - to be loved. 'And what will a mannaturally come to like and love, apart from his parent, spouse and child? Well,he will like and love being liked and loved. And so many a courtshipcompetition will be won by a person displaying exceptional devotion, and manwill generally strive, lifelong, for the affection and approval of many peoplenot related to him.'

There arepositive sides to the liking/loving tendency. It can positively impact aperson's life if he develops a liking towards an admirable person - a modelworthy of emulation. 'Liking or loving, intertwined with admiration in afeedback mode, often has vast practical consequences in areas far removed fromsexual attachments. For instance, a man who is so constructed that he lovesadmirable persons and ideas with a special intensity has a huge advantage inlife. This blessing came to both Buffett and myself in large measure, sometimesfrom the same persons and ideas. One common, beneficial example for us both wasWarren's uncle, Fred Buffett, who cheerfully did the endless grocery-store workthat Warren and I ended up admiring from a safe distance. Even now, after Ihave known so many other people, I doubt if it is possible to be a nicer manthan Fred Buffett was, and he changed me for the better.'

 

 

In corporations

Think howcompanies use celebrities to induce viewers to develop a liking for theirproducts. The on-air promotion by Deepika Padukone of the Tanishq jewellery forher mom has more than 18 lakh hits on YouTube as of this writing. What if evena fraction of those viewers decides to visit the nearest Tanishq store?

 

In Investing

The moststraightforward example where this tendency is visible is scores of investorsand even fund managers who have gained from learning sound investing principlesfrom Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger. In the absence of that influence, manyinvestors would take other unproductive routes like technicals, short-termtrading, chasing market trends, buying hot stocks, etc.

The flipside of this tendency is when an investor develops a possessiveness about astock that he owns. An investor emotionally attached to his stock mayconsciously or subconsciously become oblivious of changing realities. Manyinvestors continued to invest in realty stocks even as these companies piled onhuge debts to get ahead in the bidding game. Many investors similarly kept onholding on to infrastructure stocks. They were caught between mountain of debtsand slowdown in the economy.
