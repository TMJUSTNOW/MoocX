If youthink that’s a big number, you would be surprised to note that more people dieevery year due to seasonal flu. But even then, swine flu caused much greaterpanic than the regular flu. What could be the reason for that?

 Or

Considerthe following example. In the months after the September 11 terrorist attacksin the US in 2001, travelers made the decision that traveling by roadwas a far safer option than by air.

In lightof the recency of those air attacks, this decision seemed an obvious and wiseone. After all, at ‘that’ time, it was far easier to imagine something badhappening when traveling by air than traveling by a car.

 

Forgetcars, more people are killed every year from attacks by donkeys and by drowningin swimming pools than those who die in plane crashes!

But justafter a plane crash, or a virus scare, we give more prominence to those killersthan anything else. So what is the reason for that?

 

Theanswer lies within our minds. These cases suggest the prevalence of whatneuro-scientists call…

 

Availability Bias

Psychologists define availability bias as aphenomenon in which people predict the frequency of an event based on howeasily an example can be brought to mind.

Thisphenomenon was first reported by psychologists Amos Tversky and DanielKahneman, who also identified the representativeness bias.

Availabilitybias is created largely due to widespread and extensive media coverage ofunusual events, such as swine flu or airline accidents, and less coverage ofmore routine, less sensational events, such as common flu or car accidents.

Forexample, when asked to rate the probability of a variety of causes of death,people tend to rate more ‘newsworthy’ events as more likely because they canmore readily recall an example from memory.

So arecent plane crash invokes fear of flying. This is despite the fact that, asper a study done in the US, the chances of a plane crash are roughly 6,000,000to one, or 0.00002%!

On theother hand, you are about 65 times more likely to die in your own car than in aplane! But since the ‘availability’ of news on one plane crash is much more andextensive than hundreds of fatal car accidents, the former invokes a greaterfear.

Here area few other examples… 

- Divorces among celebrities     and scandals among politicians attract much attention, and instances will     come easily to mind. You are therefore likely to exaggerate the frequency     of both celebrity divorces and political scandals. 
- Personal experiences,     pictures, and vivid examples are more available than incidents that     happened to others, or mere words, or statistics. A judicial error that     affects you will undermine your faith in the justice system more than a     similar incident you read about in a newspaper. 
- In the stock market, we try     to fixate on learning from our own mistakes instead of learning from     others’ mistakes. So, scam in a company whose shares you hold will shake     your confidence in corporate governance inside companies more than a     similar scam in a company whose stock you do not own. 
- People who watch too many spy     movies see conspiracies everywhere. 
- For a CEO who has enjoyed     several successes in a row, failures don’t come easily to his mind. 

In simpleterms, due to availability bias, the more vivid and easily imaginable a riskis, the scarier it feels.

 

Availability Bias - General Idea 

Humanbrains tends to drift into working with what’s easily available to it.The humanbrain tends to drift into working with what’s easily available to it.

Mungergives a beautiful example of the availability-misweighing tendency with a FrankSinatra song that goes, 'When I'm not near the girl I love, I love the girl I'mnear.'

The braincan’t use what it can’t remember...

.or whatit is blocked from recognizing under the influence of certain psychologicaltendencies

Theresult? Mind tends to over-weigh what’s easily available to it

 

 

3 Reasons We Fall for Availability Bias

Reason #1 – Recentactivity: Something which is more recent occupies morerecalling power in the brain compared to something that happened long ago andhence we tend to weigh that activity as more important than others. Forexample, your tendency to go in a train (unless you absolutely have to) isextremely low immediately after a train bomb blast.

Similarly,our tendency is to avoid an area that had a terrorist attack recently despitethe fact that the place is safer immediately next day after the attack thanlet’s say 10 years after it.

“Gambler’s fallacy” is a classic phenomenon explaining this bias because of recentevents.

Investopediadefines it this way…

When an individual erroneously believes that the onset of a certainrandom event is less likely to happen following an event or a series of events.This line of thinking is incorrect because past events do not change theprobability that certain events will occur in the future.

For example, consider a series of 20 coin flips that have all landedwith the “heads” side up. Under the gambler’s fallacy, a person might predictthat the next coin flip is more likely to land with the “tails” side up.

Moredetails [here](http://k2invest.blogspot.in/2015/11/latticework-of-mental-models-gamblers.html).

 

Reason #2 – PersonalExperience: Something which has happened to us is easyto recall compared to something which has not. Since your all senses areinvolved in personal experiences, the impression in the memory is significantand hence it’s easily re-callable.

 

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/AF910E2B-F339-914B-B791-16F893D97DBF.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OZ2Omf-0Gfg/Vn0fwZZsd1I/AAAAAAAA5Lk/Y2kqXYlHvDU/s1600/availabilitybias-personal%2Bexperience2.png)

Reason #3 – Vividness: The more vivid the thing, the easier it is to recall for the brain.The technique (vividity) which works as a brilliant memory tool, ironically,also acts as an impediment in logical reasoning due to our tendency tooverweigh the importance of a vivid event compared to a ‘not-so-vivid’ event.

 

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/8BEA67CB-F831-364F-8AAE-C54983A45431.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z5OPlqpFPPY/Vn0f2wAPWbI/AAAAAAAA5Ls/EeqoXyFB5Ss/s1600/vividness-availabilitybias3.png)

Add toall the above our tendency to further look for confirming evidences and we havethings so strong that they are most often recalled by our brains during thedecision making process.

Examples of Availability Bias

[Prediction Newsletter Scam](http://k2invest.blogspot.com/2016/01/prediction-newsletter-scam.html)

On RareEvents“I visited Israel several times during a period in which suicide bombingsin buses were relatively common—though of course quite rare in absolute terms.There were altogether 23 bombings between December 2001 and September 2004,which had caused a total of 236 fatalities. The number of daily bus riders inIsrael was approximately 1.3 million at that time. For any traveler, the riskswere tiny, but that was not how the public felt about it.People avoided busesas much as they could, and many travelers spent their time on the bus anxiouslyscanning their neighbors for packages or bulky clothes that might hide a bomb.I did not have much occasion to travel on buses, as I was driving a rented car,but I was chagrined to discover that my behavior was also affected. I foundthat I did not like to stop next to a bus at a red light, and I drove away morequickly than usual when the light changed. I was ashamed of myself, because ofcourse I knew better. I knew that the risk was truly negligible, and that anyeffect at all on my actions would assign an inordinately high “decision weight”to a minuscule probability. In fact, I was more likely to be injured in adriving accident than by stopping near a bus. But my avoidance of buses was notmotivated by a rational concern for survival. What drove me was the experienceof the moment:being next to a bus made me think of bombs, and these thoughtswere unpleasant. I was avoiding buses because I wanted to think of somethingelse.”“My experience illustrates how terrorism works and why it is soeffective: it induces an availability cascade. An extremely vivid image ofdeath and damage, constantly reinforced by media attention and frequentconversations, becomes highly accessible, especially if it is associated with aspecific situation such as the sight of a bus. The emotional arousal isassociative, automatic, and uncontrolled, and it produces an impulse forprotective action.System 2 may “know” that the probability is low, but thisknowledge does not eliminate the self-generated discomfort and the wish toavoid it. System 1cannot be turned off.”

“Theemotion is not only disproportionate to the probability, it is also insensitiveto the exact level of probability. Suppose that two cities have been warnedabout the presence of suicide bombers. Residents of one city are told that twobombers are ready to strike. Residents of another city are told of a singlebomber. Their risk is lower by half, but do they feel much safer?”

Thepsychology of high-prize lotteries is similar to the psychology of terrorism.The thrilling possibility of winning the big prize is shared by the communityand reinforced by conversations at work and at home. Buying a ticket isimmediately rewarded by pleasant fantasies, just as avoiding a buswasimmediately rewarded by relief from fear. In both cases, the actual probabilityis inconsequential; only possibility matters.

a basiclimitation in the ability of our mind to deal with small risks is that weeither ignore them altogether or give them far too much weight —nothing inbetween. Excessive over-reaction vs. Utter neglect.It depends on“availability”Terrorism vs. Climate Change.

Smith,1907, Captain, RMSTitanic

Thechances of winning are 10% in urn A and 9% in urn B, so making the right choiceshould be easy, but it is not: about 30%–40% of students choose the urn withthe larger number of winning marbles, rather than the urn that provides abetter chance ofwinning.The remarkably foolish choices that people make in thissituation is called denominator neglect. If your attention is drawn tothewinning marbles, you do not assess the number of non-winning marbles withthe same care. Vivid imagery contributes to denominator neglect.When I think ofthe small urn, I see a single red marble on a vaguely defined background ofwhite marbles. When I think of the larger urn, I see nine winning red marbleson an indistinct background of white marbles, which creates a more hopefulfeeling.The distinctive vividness of the winning marbles increases the decisionweight of that event, enhancing the possibility effect.

Insensitivityto Base Rates (Probability unconditioned on featured evidence)Base rate is theprobability unconditioned on featural evidence, frequently also known as priorprobabilities. For example, if it were the case that 1% of the public are"medical professionals" and 99% of the public are not "medicalprofessionals," then the base rates in this case are 1% and 99%,respectively.

instructingpeople to “think like a statistician” enhanced the use of base-rateinformation, while the instruction to “think like a clinician” had the oppositeeffect.Amos and I originally believed, on the basis of our early evidence, thatbase-rate information will always be neglected when information about thespecific instance is available, but that conclusion was too strong.Psychologists have conducted many experiments in which base-rate information isexplicitly provided as part of the problem, and many of the participants areinﬂuenced by those base rates, although the information about the individualcase is almost always weighted more than mere statistics. Norbert Schwarz andhis colleagues showed that instructing people to “think like a statistician”enhanced the use of base-rate information, while the instruction to “think likea clinician” had the opposite effect.

AnchoringBias as a subset of Availability Bias We need anchors What are the rightanchors?What are the wrong anchors?

VideoClip on Anchoring

Twodifferent mechanisms produce anchoring effects— one for each system.Two different mechanisms produce anchoringeffects—one for each system. There is a form of anchoring that occurs in adeliberate process of adjustment, an operation of System 2. And there isanchoring that occurs by a priming effect, an automatic manifestation of System1.

InsufficientAdjustment“Start from an anchoring number, assess whether it is too high or toolow,and gradually adjust your estimate by mentally “moving” from the anchor.Theadjustment typically ends prematurely, because people stop when they are nolonger certain that they should move farther.”

“Amos andI once rigged a wheel of fortune. It was marked from 0 to 100, but we had itbuilt so that it would stop only at 10 or We recruited students of theUniversity of Oregon as participants in our experiment. One of us would standin front of a small group, spin the wheel, and ask them to write down thenumber on which the wheel stopped, which of course was either 10or We thenasked them two questions: Is the percentage of African nations among UN memberslarger or smaller than the number you just wrote? What is your best guess ofthe percentage of African nations in the UN? The spin of a wheel offortune—even one that is not rigged—cannot possibly yield useful informationabout anything, and the participants in our experiment should simply have ignoredit. But they did not ignore it. The average estimates of those who saw 10 and65 were 25% and 45%,respectively.”

Adjustmentis Effortful, System 2 Operation“Nick Epley and Tom Gilovich found evidencethat adjustment is a deliberate attempt to ﬁndreasons to move away from theanchor: people who are instructed to shake their head when they hear theanchor, as if they rejected it, move farther from the anchor, and people whonod their head show enhanced anchoring. Epley and Gilovich also conﬁrmed thatadjustment is an effortful operation. People adjust less (stay closer to theanchor) when their mental resources are depleted,either because their memory isloaded with digits or because they are slightly drunk. Insufficientadjustmentis a failure of a weak or lazy System 2.”

Priminghttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1OVhlRpwJc

Primedfor Money“Reminders of money produce some troubling effects. Participants inone experiment were shown a list of five words from which they were requiredtoconstruct a four-word phrase that had a money theme (“high a salary deskpaying” became “a high-paying salary”). Other primes were much moresubtle,including the presence of an irrelevant money-related object in thebackground, such as a stack of Monopoly money on a table, or a computer withascreen saver of dollar bills floating in water. Money-primed people becomemore independent than they would be without the associative trigger.Theypersevered almost twice as long in trying to solve a very difficult problembefore they asked the experimenter for help, a crisp demonstration ofincreasedself-reliance. Money-primed people are also more selfish: they weremuch less willing to spend time helping another student who pretended tobeconfused about an experimental task. When an experimenter clumsily dropped abunch of pencils on the floor, the participants with money(unconsciously) ontheir mind picked up fewer pencils. In another experiment in the series,participants were told that they would shortly have a get-acquaintedconversation with another person and were asked to set up two chairs while theexperimenter left to retrieve that person. Participants primedby money chose tostay much farther apart than their nonprimed peers (118 vs. 80 centimeters).Money-primed undergraduates also showed a greater preference for being alone.The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primesindividualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, todepend on others, orto accept demands from others. The psychologist who has done this remarkableresearch, Kathleen Vohs, has been laudably restrained in discussing theimplications of her findings, leaving the task to her readers.

Overweighingwhat can be counted “You’ve got a complex system and it spews out a lot ofwonderful numbers that enable you to measure some factors.“But there are otherfactors that are terribly important, [yet] there’s noprecise numbering you canput to these factors. “You know they’reimportant, but you don’t have thenumbers. Well practically everybody (1)overweighs the stuff that can benumbered, because it yields to thestatistical techniques they’re taught inacademia. “and (2) doesn’t mix in thehard-to-measure stuff that may be moreimportant.

How to handle availability bias?

(Readfrom BFBV L3)

How doyou stay away from the availability-misweighing tendency? Munger recommendsusing checklists, which, he says, he has found helpful. A second antidote is tobehave like Darwin and search out for disconfirming evidence. Yet another is tosearch for people who are sceptical of incumbent notions. They can help you.

 

Availability Bias in Corporations

Oftenfound in: Instances where the brain the most readily optionavailable to it

InCorporations: Availability works wonders for corporations which have theirproducts most closely available to prospective customers. That is how globalcola majors Coca-Cola and Pepsi play their game - being the most readilyavailable option. Charlie Munger says, 'Ask the Coca-Cola Company, which hasraised availability to a secular religion, if availability changes behavior.You will drink a helluva lot more Coke if it's always available. I meanavailability does change behavior and cognition.'

 

Availability Bias in Investing 

Ininvesting: This tendency provides fuel to 24-hour business channels, whichanalyse threadbare how a particular quarter's performance can make or break acompany. What the reporters do here is use the most readily availableinformation and try to extrapolate it into the future. So, a company that hasperformed well gets a pat on the back and is often hard-sold, whereas one thatmay have seen a dip in the most recent performance is blasted to kingdom come.Take Sun Pharma's most recent quarterly result. The company, struggling to putRanbaxy in shape, has warned that it could take more time than thought earlier.Weak operating performance has seen analysts downgrade the stock. Does Sun'scurrent problems appear a long- term headache? Sun has exhibited in the pastthat it can successfully assimilate its acquisitions, Ranbaxy being itsbiggest. Yet assuming that the current problems will persist forever or thatSun may not be able to turn around Ranbaxy is giving very narrow space to thefounder of the country's largest and most successful pharma company. Thecompany may indeed be successful.
