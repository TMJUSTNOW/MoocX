This article is the tenth of this weeklyseries called [Latticework of Mental Models](http://www.safalniveshak.com/category/mental-models/), which will be authored by my friend andpartner in writing the [Value Investing Almanack](http://almanack.safalniveshak.com/), Anshul Khare. Anshul will write onvarious mental models – big ideas from various disciplines – which can help youthink more rationally while analyzing businesses and making your stockinvestment decisions.

 

 

# Definition

[[a16z](https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/network-effects_critical-mass/)]The term“critical mass” came into use around 1941 though it originally had a verylimited definition: the minimum amount of a given fissionable materialnecessary to sustain a nuclear chain reaction at a constant rate. While not thefirst to use the term in a physics setting, the physicist Leo Szilard is saidto be the first person to propose that a chain reaction could be createdstarting from a critical mass of uranium. And that’s the critical point behindthe concept as we apply it today.

Soon,other disciplines began to use the term “critical mass” as a mental model. Oneof the first people to apply it to the social sciences was the same person whocreated the mental models construct — Herbert Simon. His influential essay oncritical mass, “Bandwagon and underdog effects and the possibility of electionpredictions”, was published in 1954. (Simon later went on to win the NobelPrize “for his pioneering research into the decision-making process withineconomic organizations”.)

Otherdefinitions of critical mass exist for other disciplines. In business, criticalmass [refers](http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/economics/critical-mass-623) to “the size a company needs toreach in order to efficiently and competitively participate in the market. Thisis also the size a company must attain in order to sustain growth andefficiency.” 

 

# Case of Bamboo tree

It’ssaid that you can find extraordinary intelligence in nature. To unearth thisbrilliance, all you need is curious eyes and close observation. In that spirit,let me start today with the story of a Chinese bamboo tree. Imagine that youwere given few Chinese bamboo seeds and asked to grow them. You take the littleseed, plant it, and start watering it. You add fertilizer and wait patientlyfor the seed to turn into a plant. You wait for a whole year, and nothinghappens.

Thesecond year you continue to water it and fertilize it, but still nothinghappens. Looks like somebody is testing your patience.

Thethird year you water it and fertilize it, and the same story repeats i.e., novisible results. Many people would have given up on the tree by this time. Butnot you. At least not in my story.

Thetwist in the tale comes sometime during the fifth year. One fine day a tinybamboo sprout breaks through the ground. Yay! Your happiness knows no bounds,after all you didn’t give up and your perseverance finally paid off.

Whilethe neighbouring trees are bullying the innocent baby bamboo, you wish that thetiny sapling at least lives for few more weeks. But the bamboo tree has someother plans.

Whattranspires in the next few weeks is phenomenal. In a matter of six weeks thatpuny sapling shoots up in the sky, not stopping until it achieves a dizzyingheight of ninety feet. This unreal growth leaves you flabbergasted and thefellow trees in shambles.

Whatthe heck happened? To many readers, this story might sound familiar. Butchances are that you were told this story in a different context. The anecdoteis quite popular among motivational coaches and self-help gurus who use thismetaphor to extol the virtues of tenacity and never-give-up attitude.

Theirpep talks sound something like – “Don’t give up!Keep putting in efforts and the results will one day come like the Chinesebamboo tree!”

I don’tdisagree with them, however, my intention here is not to motivate you. I wantto dig deeper and try to unravel an interesting mental model depicted by thisphenomenon. So let me start by putting out some obvious questions on the table.

- What do you think was going     on in the case of the Chinese bamboo tree?
- Was there really nothing     happening at all in the first five years?
- Why did the visible growth     happen so fast in such a short period of time?
- Is it just the Chinese     bamboo tree, or are there other areas where a similar pattern can be     observed?

The Big idea from Physics

Beforewe can make an attempt to answer those questions, we need to understand thenotion of Critical Mass which made its debut in nuclear physics.

Ican almost hear you yawning – “Anshul, if electrons and nucleus excitedme so much, do you really think I would be worried about P/Es and ROEs? C’mon,I’m here to learn about investing and you’re boring me with nuclear physics!”

Well, Iknow nuclear physics excites very few. So before you run away, let me justreassure you that I’ll be done with my physics lecture even before you openyour eyes.

Ipromise it won’t hurt. Ready?

Innuclear physics, Critical Mass is the minimum amount of a given fissilematerial (raw material for nuclear reaction) necessary to achieve aself-sustaining fission chain reaction. The term, however, is now used as amuch broader construct. In astrophysics, for example, Critical Mass is aconcept used to designate any mass that when exceeded causes something tohappen.

You canopen your eyes now. 

 

Jokesaside, Critical Mass can be understood by observing something as simple as ametal spring. A spring goes back to its original size and shape when yourelease it after stretching it a bit. However, if stretched beyond a certainlimit, it merely deforms rather than returning to its original position. Thatlimit is akin to the critical mass for the spring.

Tomake it more clear, I want to take Peter Bevelin’s help. So let me draw yourattention to this excerpt from his book, [Seeking Wisdom](http://amzn.to/1C8Fcay) –

At a certain scale, a system reaches a critical mass or a limitwhere the behavior of the system may change dramatically. It may work better,worse, cease to work or change properties.

Small interactions over time slowly accumulate into a critical state– where the degree ofinstability increases. A small event may then trigger a dramatic change like anearthquake.

A small change may have no effect on a system until a criticalthreshold is reached. For example, a drug may be ineffective up until a certainthreshold and then become effective, or it may become more and more effective,but then become harmful.

Another example is from chemistry. When a system of chemicalsreaches a certain level of interaction, the system undergoes a dramatic change.A small change in a factor may have an unnoticeable effect but a further changemay cause a system to reach a critical threshold making the system work betteror worse.

A system may also reach a threshold when its properties suddenlychange from one type of order to another. For example, when a ferromagnet isheated to a critical temperature it loses its magnetization. As it is cooledback below that temperature, magnetism returns.

Thismental model finds its relevance not only in physics but in scores of otherareas. Let’s explore some of them.

Critical Mass as Tipping Point

MalcolmGladwell has done a brilliant job of refining this concept further to explainthe phenomenon of epidemics, like social trends or contagion of ideas, in hisbook [The Tipping Point](http://amzn.to/1j3gKCF).

Theadvent and popularity of fax machines is an interesting case study he explainedin his book –

Sharp introduced the first low-priced fax machine in 1984, and soldabout 80,000 of those machines in the United States in that first year. For thenext three years, business slowly and steadily bought more and more faxes,until, in 1987, enough people had faxes that it made sense for everyone to geta fax. Nineteen eighty-seven was the fax machine Tipping Point. A millionmachines were sold that year, and by 1989 two million new machines had goneinto operation.

It’svery interesting to note that, using the concept of Critical Mass, a lot ofsocial behavior can be decoded like how rumors spread, voting, mob behaviour(leading to strikes or riots), adoption of new technology, consumer behaviour,education, and host of other things.

FarnamStreet has put together some [great insights and relevant examples](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2009/09/mental-model-critical-mass/)describing the above situations in the light of Critical Mass mental model.

Comingback to the Chinese bamboo tree puzzle, now we have some clues to explain theexplosive growth. Although, outwardly nothing significant seemed to haveoccurred for the first five years but the bamboo roots, underneath the ground,were slowly taking shape and growing steadily. In effect, the foundation wasgetting built to support the upcoming rapid growth.

Themoment a critical mass, in terms of amount of roots required for externalgrowth, was achieved the bamboo sampling broke free and grew with a nonlinearspeed. You could say that the day, when bamboo sapling saw the sunlight for thefirst time, was the tipping point.

Checkoutthe non-linearity as shown in the graph above. In any system prone to criticalmass effect, the tipping point is where the non-linearity kicks in. For thatmatter, the boiling point and the freezing point for water are kind of tippingpoints where the state transition happens for the water.

Anothergreat example around us is the city traffic. On any given day the trafficaffects our commute time. If you increase the traffic by twice, our commutetime may also increase by a factor of two. However, at a certain point,addition of few more cars chokes the road completely and the vehicles movementcomes to a grinding halt. The number of cars on the road at that inflectionpoint can be dubbed as the Critical Mass for the commute system.

Critical Mass and Lollapalooza

Whenit comes to multidisciplinary learning, one leg of the latticework of mentalmodels is hinged on the idea of Critical Mass. Take a look at the definition ofLollapalooza as defined in [Poor Charlie’s Almanack](http://amzn.to/1bXAXnA) –

Lollapalooza is, as personified by Charles Munger, the critical massobtained via a combination of concentration, curiosity, perseverance, andself-criticism, applied through a prism of multidisciplinary mental models.

If youcould look at the world from Charlie’s eyes, who according to Warren Buffetthas the world’s best 30-second brain, majority of the worldly problems would beno-brainers. Simply put, when you learn the most important mental models andstart applying them for problem solving, you will realize that multiple modelsseem to converge in one direction and together they form the dynamic criticalmass for a cascading of positive effects – a lollapalooza. It simplifies yourdecision making tremendously.

Critical Mass in Business and Investing

WarrenBuffett suggests that for finding great businesses, one should look for strongmoats. And one of the underlying forces for a moat is economies of scale.

Acompany may reach a certain critical size, writes Peter Bevelin in [Seeking Wisdom](http://amzn.to/1C8Fcay)…

…and get advantages of scale in experience purchasing, marketing,manufacturing, administration, research, logistics, distribution, etc. Forexample, expenses can be spread out over larger amounts of volume, loweringaverage costs. These advantages often permit greater specialization, makingpeople better at what they do.

That’sthe positive side of Critical Mass. How about it’s role in understanding thefinancial disasters?

Thinkabout the 2008 economic crisis. One of the factors contributing to the fiascowas poor quality debt issued by financial institutions. Now, in a healthyeconomy, few bad practices and bad loans can be absorbed without much news.However, when certain factors related to environment and regulations promotethe misaligned incentives, they end up triggering positive feedback loopsfeeding the bad. Remember [Gresham’s Law](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-mental-models-greshams-law/)?

Unfortunately,before a Critical Mass (of bad debt) could be achieved, no dramatic changeswere visible for a long time. And one fine day in 2008, people were caught offguard when the whole financial system tipped.

Remindsme of the saying – “It is the last straw that breaks thecamel’s back.”

Perhaps,the first bad loan (packaged as mortgage backed security) which defaulted andthe first buyer in the stock market who couldn’t find another buyer became thelast pieces of the Critical Mass puzzle.

Conclusion

Foreons, people have been searching for the magic recipe for wealth and happiness.In this search, they often look up to the uber-successful or ultra-wealthyindividuals in contemporary society, hoping that they would divulge the secret.

We arelucky to be alive in an era where people like Charlie Munger, world’s leadingauthority on multidisciplinary thinking, have literally been shouting thesecret from the rooftops since decades.

Superiorperformance in life and in investing, according to Mr. Munger, doesn’t comefrom a magic formula. It comes from what he calls “constant search for bettermethods of thought,” a willingness to prepay through rigorous preparation, andfrom the extraordinary outcomes of multidisciplinary research model.

Ibelieve that luck plays a significant role in defining the direction of our lives andfor me it was a wonderful stroke of luck that I stumbled upon the teachings ofCharlie Munger. I must confess that, after discovering him, I lost my right toblame luck for my failures.

Thisis as far as luck could have taken me – to the doorsteps of school of worldly wisdom. Now it’s up to me.

I hopeyou agree with me. And I hope you take the responsibility of acquiring worldlywisdom seriously.

When Icompile these posts, I imagine myself sitting in front of you and having thisconversation face to face. That creates a subtle fear in my mind that I mightnot be able to answer your doubts and questions. This subconscious fear makesme think hard before writing. Can you guess who benefits the most from thisprocess? Yours truly i.e., me. 

 

BeforeI close, let me rehash an important insight about learning. I’ll quote BenjaminFranklin who said –

Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and Ilearn.

Sodon’t just read, get involved. Don’t just learn, go out and teach.

Takecare and keep learning.
