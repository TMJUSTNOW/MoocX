Let’s start with a small riddle.

A man, probably a statistician, believesthat his next child will be a girl since his wife has already borne him threesons.

Do you find his argument convincing?

The argument intuitively doesn’t feels right.Isn’t it? But why?

We’ll circle back to this puzzle but beforethat let me indulge you in another interesting thought experiment.

Imagine yourself as a spectator in a coinflipping tournament. You notice that in one of the plays, the coin has landedon heads for 5 consecutive flips. If you were given an opportunity to bet onthe next flip, would you bet on heads or tails?

I know you’re a value investor and don’tbelieve in speculating or gambling away your hard earned money on frivolouscoin flipping tournaments, but this being a thought experiment I would requestyou to play along.

So what’s your answer?

The basic concepts of probability tells us thatfor random events like coin flips, both the head or tail are equal likely. Inother words the probability of a head and a tail are both 1/2 (0.5).

So using my elementary knowledge ofprobability, I would reason that the universe will try to balance out the toomany heads.

When I use this argument to put my bet ontails, I am falling for a bias called Gambler’s Fallacy.

The Gambler’s Fallacy is the mistakenbelief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during someperiod, it will happen less frequently in the future, or that, if somethinghappens less frequently than normal during some period, it will happen morefrequently in the future (presumably as a means of balancing nature).

That explains why our statistician friend’sargument is flawed. The gender of the fourth child is causally unrelated to anypreceding chance events or series of such events. His chances of having adaughter are no better than 1 in 2 i.e., 50-50.

With independent events (the gender of kids,result of toss using a fair coin, etc.) there is no harmonising force at work.The coin doesn’t know that it had landed heads in the last 5 tosses.

The most famous example of thegambler’s fallacy occurred in a game of roulette at the Monte Carlo Casino in1913 when the ball fell in black 26 times in a row. This was an extremelyuncommon occurrence, although no more or less common than any of the other67,108,863 sequences of 26 red or black. Gamblers lost millions of francsbetting against black, reasoning incorrectly that the streak was causing an“imbalance” in the randomness of the wheel, and that it had to be followed by along streak of red. (source: [Wikipedia](http://safalniveshak.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dfffd9e0dc3c1e2bec89cab7a&id=a7ab557d85&e=1a99b5f8c8))

So why is it called a gambler’s fallacy?Because it’s rampant in gamblers and speculators.

There was a guy who claimed that he had ascientific way of playing the lottery. He diligently maintained a spreadsheetof winning numbers and would bet on those numbers which had appeared the least.Alas! another victim of Gambler’s fallacy.

Now if a coin (a fair one) has equalprobability (50:50) of turning heads or tails then why is it fallacious toexpect a tail after 5 consecutive heads? That’s a fair question to ask.

To answer that, let me take helpfrom Daniel Kahneman. In his book, [Thinking Fast and Slow](http://safalniveshak.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dfffd9e0dc3c1e2bec89cab7a&id=232ac5dcab&e=1a99b5f8c8), Danny writes …

People expect that a sequence ofevents generated by a random process [coin toss] will represent the essentialcharacteristics [equal probability of head and tail] of that process even whenthe sequence is short [few tosses]. In considering tosses of a coin for headsor tails, for example, people regard the sequence H-T-H- T-T-H to be morelikely than the sequence H-H-H-T-T-T, which does not appear random, and alsomore likely than the sequence H-H-H-H-T-H, which does not represent thefairness of the coin. Thus, people expect that the essential characteristics ofthe process will be represented, not only globally in the entire sequence, butalso locally in each of its parts. A locally representative sequence [thesequence of 5 heads which you observed], however, deviates systematically fromchance expectation: it contains too many alternations and too few runs.

Another consequence of the belief inlocal representativeness is the well-known gambler’s fallacy. After observing along run of red on the roulette wheel, for example, most people erroneouslybelieve that black is now due, presumably because the occurrence of black willresult in a more representative sequence than the occurrence of an additionalred. Chance is commonly viewed as a self-correcting process in which adeviation in one direction induces a deviation in the opposite direction torestore the equilibrium. In fact, deviations are not “corrected” as a chanceprocess unfolds, they are merely diluted.

Kahneman’s insights are remarkable. So if youdidn’t understand the above two paragraphs, please read them slowly and thenre-read them.

Now if you were given an opportunity to bet onmany such tosses, say 100 tosses, what would be your strategy for betting?Again the assumption being that it’s a fair coin (with no specific bias foreither head or tail) and with the knowledge that probabilities are still 50:50.

Kahneman explains this using an anecdote aboutfamous economist Paul Samuelson. He writes …

The great PaulSamuelson—a giant among the economists of the twentieth century—famously askeda friend whether he would accept a gamble on the toss of a coin in which hecould lose 100orwin100orwin200. His friend responded, “I won’t bet because I wouldfeel the 100lossmorethanthe100lossmorethanthe200 gain. But I’ll take you on if youpromise to let me make 100 such bets.” Unless you are a decision theorist, youprobably share the intuition of Samuelson’s friend, that playing a veryfavorable but risky gamble multiple times reduces the subjective risk.

Samuelson’s friend was prettysmart. He understood that Gambler’s fallacy arises out of a belief in a [law of small numbers](http://safalniveshak.us2.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=dfffd9e0dc3c1e2bec89cab7a&id=d4482af8fa&e=1a99b5f8c8), or the erroneous belief that small samplesmust be representative of the larger population. Hence he was willing to bet onthe aggregate outcome of bigger sample size than a single outcome.

You probably noticed that I have beenmentioning the use of a faircoin for our tosses. A fair coin ensures thepre-condition for a gambler’s fallacy to hold true, i.e. independent events.

Gambler’s Fallacy – Reversed!

If I told you that in the same coin tossingtournament, there is play where the coin has turned heads for 50 consecutivetosses. What would you bet on for the 51st coin toss?

The probability of that happening, using a faircoin, is 1 in a 1100 trillion but there’s also a chance that the coin isbiased. A biased coin or an imperfect roulette wheel can also lead to outcomeslike 5 consecutive heads but for totally different reasons. In these cases thegambler’s fallacy might superficially seem to apply, when it actually does not.

If you suspect that you’re dealing with abiased coin or a loaded dice, it’s reasonable to expect that long streak ofskewed outcomes are not due to randomness. But sometimes human brain takes ittoo far in the other direction when a belief in the idea of hot hand takesroot.

This is the reverse of gambler’s fallacy, alsoknown as hot hand fallacy. It originates from basketball where players whoscored several times in a row are believed to have a hot hand, i.e. are morelikely to score at their next attempt.

In cricket, players are often declared tobe “in-form” and are expected to consistently perform above average until theform lasts. Perhaps a hot-batfallacy! 

At first the idea of gambler’sfallacy might look paradoxical to the [mental model of mean reversion](http://safalniveshak.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dfffd9e0dc3c1e2bec89cab7a&id=958493e52e&e=1a99b5f8c8) but it’s not. In his book, [The Art of Thinking Clearly](http://safalniveshak.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dfffd9e0dc3c1e2bec89cab7a&id=d718c43845&e=1a99b5f8c8), Rolf Dobelli explains the subtle differencebetween the two.

…if you areexperiencing record cold where you live, it is likely that the temperature willreturn to normal values over the next few days, If the weather functioned likea casino, there would be 50% chance that the temperature would rise and a 50%chance that it would drop. But the weather is not like a casino. Complex [feedback](http://safalniveshak.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dfffd9e0dc3c1e2bec89cab7a&id=fe3cc491a4&e=1a99b5f8c8) mechanisms in the atmosphere ensures that extremes balancethemselves out.

So, take a closer look at theindependent and interdependent events around you. Purely independent eventsreally only exist at the casino, in the lottery and in theory. In real life, inthe financial markets and in business, with the weather and your health, eventsare often interrelated.

Which means a domain prone totruly random and independent events, like a casino, is more prone to gambler’sfallacy. However, in systems which behave like [complex adaptive systems](http://safalniveshak.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dfffd9e0dc3c1e2bec89cab7a&id=4a634331f5&e=1a99b5f8c8) i.e. prone to self correction, both meanreversion (negative feedback loops) and extreme outcomes (positive feedbackloops) are a possibility.

In Investing

In stock markets how many times have we heard,‘whatever goes up must come down’ or ‘how much more can it drop?’.

These beliefs are a manifestation ofgambler’s fallacy in investor’s behaviour. Vishal is fond of quoting theexample –

A stock that falls 95%, first fell90% and from that level fell another 50%.

When Warren Buffett said, “turnarounds seldomturn” he probably had gambler’s fallacy in mind.

Expecting that the future events will smoothenout the stock prices, just because it has been falling for ‘n’ continuoustrading days, is an irrational way of thinking.

Sometimes investors abruptly change theirbelief from gambler’s fallacy to hot-hand fallacy. When their patience runsout, having lost money by betting on outcomes which are supposedly “longoverdue”, they tend to go overboard in assuming that a stock has come toits “form” and will continue it’s trend. They bet heavily on the new “trend”and right then the tide turns and the roaring market makes a mincemeat out ofthose unsuspecting hot-hand believers.

Conclusion

Typically humans intuitively find it hard todeal with randomness as a result we tend to put a tremendous amount of weighton previous events, believing that they’ll somehow influence future outcomes.Gambler’s fallacy dictates that the idea of “balancing force of the universe”is a baloney.

Today’s idea requires you to understandthe basics of probability. If you aren’t acquainted with the basicprobability concepts, you need to learn it else you might end up like theproverbial (as described by Charlie Munger) single legged man in anass-kicking contest.

You must have noticed that I have referred toquite a few mental models which have appeared in this series before, and youmight be feeling overwhelmed finding so many links.

Please understand that as you learn more ideas,you are bound to find more and more connections between those ideas. And that’show a useful worldview is created – by constructing a framework ofinterconnected ideas.

That’s what a real latticework looks like.Building such a latticework serves the purpose of saving us from biggesterrors in thinking and decision making – in our private lives, at work or inbusiness.

Take care and keep learning.
