Framing

[Example 1 - The CFL Story](http://k2invest.blogspot.in/2015/01/the-cfl-story.html)

 

Example 2 - Discussion between Father and Son onsmoking

“Is it okay to smoke a cigarette while prayingto God?” a young man asked his father, a religious man.

“Of course it’s bad. It’s a great sin and verydisrespectful act,” the father replied. He was disturbed with his son’satrocious question.

“But last time you told me that to get rid ofmy addiction I should start praying while smoking. Didn’t you say that?” Itseemed to him that his father was contradicting himself.

“No my son! Don’t confuse smoking-while-prayingwith praying-while-smoking,” the father explained.

“But what’s the difference?” the son wasperplexed.

“There is a difference. A huge difference. Idon’t know what but my brain tells me that there is.”

Now before we get started on a debate about thevalidity of father’s argument, let me clarify that the reason I brought up thisanecdote was to highlight an important mental bias which plays out in ouraffairs very subtly.

In fact somebody made a TVcommercial [[1\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luorg8Lu0ks) on the same line of thought and I found it very amusing.

 

 

Even school kids are learning this trick tomanipulate their unsuspecting elders.

The kid knows – “It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it.” That, in short, is Framing.

The way you frame the options is veryimportant. How a message is communicated affects the way it is received. Framing has strongimplications on our behaviour. Even small and seemingly inconsequential changesin the wordings of a problem can result in large changes of preferences.

In his book, The Art of Thinking Clearly [[2\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#1501ca4620f3ec46_note2), Rolf Dobelli writes –

Glossing is a popular type offraming. Under its rules, a tumbling share price becomes ‘correction’. Anoverpaid acquisition price is branded ‘goodwill’. In every management course, aproblem magically transforms into an ‘opportunity’ or a ‘challenge’. A personwho is fired is ‘reassessing his career’. A fallen soldier – regardless of howmuch bad luck or stupidity led to his death – turns into a ‘war hero’. Genocidetranslates to ‘ethnic cleansing’.

Now, it may just seem an intelligent play ofwords. And one might be tempted to explain this human behaviour by a simplelogic – different words arouse different level of emotional response. But ifyou stop there, you’re going to miss a very critical idea here. There is morejuice than meets the eye.

It turns out that Framing is acognitive bias and hence a very important mental model from psychology. It sayspeople react differently to a particular choice depending on whether, andespecially when, it is presented as a loss or as a gain.

We find “99% fat free” food products enticingbut if the same message says “contains 1% fat”, it would trigger a differentresponse from us. Just by rearranging the available set of options, people canbe nudged to opt for a specific choice.

It’s not only a clever marketingtrick to sell products but it can effectively be used by policy makers toincrease compliance and even for improving our relationships. In case you wantto dig deeper on this, Richard Thaler has written a book called Nudge [[3\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#1501ca4620f3ec46_note3), which primarily deals with the idea of designing choicearchitectures.

What scientists and psychologists have found isthat people tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seekrisks when a negative frame is presented. Gain and loss are defined in thescenario as descriptions of outcomes (e.g. lives lost or saved, diseasepatients treated and not treated, lives saved and lost during accidents, etc.).

Framing and Loss Aversion

Framing is an outcome of our aversion tolosses. Evolution has programmed our brain to seek loss minimization instead ofgain maximizing. As a result our brains, subconsciously, are always choosingthe path of least pain.

Let’s assume that there is a way toquantify or measure the human emotions of pain or pleasure and let’s say theunits for that measure is ‘aha’. So, ideally, loss of say Rs 100 should giveyou a pain of 10 ahas and gain of Rs 100 will fetch you a pleasure of 10 ahas. Right?

Not really! The fact of the matter isthat the pain of losing Rs 100 is little more, something like 15 ahas.

Nobel Prize winning psychologistDaniel Kahneman, who is considered the father of behavioural economics,describes an experiment in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow [[4\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#1501ca4620f3ec46_note4) –

We introduced our discussion offraming by an example that has become known as the “Asian disease problem”:

Imagine that the United States ispreparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian disease, which is expected tokill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have beenproposed. Assume that the exact scientific estimates of the consequences of theprograms are as follows:

If program A is adopted, 200 peoplewill be saved. 

If program B is adopted, there is aone-third probability that 600 people will be saved and a two-thirdsprobability that no people will be saved.

A substantial majority of respondentschoose program A: they prefer the certain option over the gamble.

The outcomes of the programs areframed differently in a second version:

If program X is adopted, 400 peoplewill die. 

If program Y is adopted, there is aone-third probability that nobody will die and a two-thirds probability that600 people will die

Look closely and compare the twoversions: the consequences of programs A and X are identical; so are theconsequences of programs B and Y. In the second frame, however, a largemajority of people choose the gamble.

So we see that the way in which an uncertainpossibility is presented may have a substantial effect on how people respond toit. And many a times this has serious implications.

For example, when asked whether they wouldchoose surgery in a hypothetical medical emergency, many more people said thatthey would when the chance of survival was given as 80 percent than when thechance of death was given as 20 percent.

As you can see, it’s not the trivialmatter about to-eat-or-not-to-eat that 99% fat free ice cream. It’s the matterof life and death and still people, under the spell of Framing, falter inthinking rationally.

Framing in Investing

The problem of Framing surfacesin investor behaviour in numerous ways. Let’s look at some of them.

One of the common mistakes madeby early investors in stock market is to sell their winning stocks and hold onto their losers. It’s called Disposition Effect whichis an instance of narrow framing. Here’s an excerpt from Jana’s blog [[5\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#1501ca4620f3ec46_note5) –

…One of the main reason for this iswe like winning more than losing. Also we have a mental account for each stockthat is in our portfolio and we want to close every account with a gain. Wekeep an internal score for each stock. Instead of looking at the overallportfolio performance we look to gain from every stock. This narrow framing iscalled as disposition effect and it leads to selling winners and holdinglosers.

So narrow framing, a flavour of framing effect,is our inability to zoom out on the situation. This creates a faultyperspective. To explain this with the help of an example. Let’s say we toss acoin and offer you the following bet –

On heads, you win Rs 60. 

On tails, you lose Rs 40.

Should you accept or reject the bet? Mostpeople would reject it.

What if you had an option to accept a series ofsuch bets, say 100 coins tosses each with the same offer? Now it becomes anattractive proposal, because over a series of multiples tosses, the probabilityof head and tail is 50-50. So even if you lose money on some of the bets, yournet gains are going to be much closer to the expected value of this bet i.e.,Rs 10 per bet. That’s roughly the idea behind broad framing.

Kahneman writes –

The combination of loss aversion andnarrow framing is a costly curse. Individual investors can avoid that curse,achieving the emotional benefits of broad framing while also saving time andagony, by reducing the frequency with which they check how well theirinvestments are doing. Closely following daily fluctuations is a losingproposition, because the pain of the frequent small losses exceeds the pleasureof the equally frequent small gains. Once a quarter is enough, and many be morethan enough for individual investors. In addition to improving the emotionalquality of life, the deliberate avoidance of exposure to short-term outcomesimproves the quality of both decisions and outcomes.

So nowyou have another reason to get rid of your portfolio tracker. :) 

Breaking the Frame

So how do you overcome Framing? Peter Bevelin, author of the must read book, Seeking Wisdom [[6\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#1501ca4620f3ec46_note6), suggests –

The answers we get depend on thequestions we ask. The British philosopher Herbert Spencer said: “How oftenmisused words generate misleading thoughts.” Consider how a statement, problem,consequence, or question is presented. How is it worded? What is its context?Are we considering certain features and ignoring others? Emotional, selectiveand appealing frames influence us.

The second strategy is to invertthe problem statement. That’s called principle of inversion [[7\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#1501ca4620f3ec46_note7). By doing so, some of the things which usually remain hidden fromyour view, because of your intuitive brain, resurface and you get a fresh view.

Scientists have also discovered that using aforeign language reduces decision-making biases. Some experiments show thatframing effect disappears when choices are presented in a foreign tongue. Thatprobably happens because when you’re using your native language, your thinkingis more intuitive. The moment you’re asked to reframe the problem in adifferent language, your brain comes out of the auto-pilot mode and it has toemploy a deliberate mode of thinking. Kahneman calls it your system 2 – therational, deliberate and slower mode of thinking.

Other remedies include looking atthe problem from different vantage points [[8\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#1501ca4620f3ec46_note8) and also making provision for probabilistic thinking [[9\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#1501ca4620f3ec46_note9).

Conclusion

In his book Kahneman writes –

A remarkable aspect of your mentallife is that you are rarely stumped … The normal state of your mind is that youhave intuitive feelings and opinions about almost everything that comes yourway. You like or dislike people long before you know much about them; you trustor distrust strangers without knowing why; you feel that an enterprise is boundto succeed without analyzing it.

This overconfidence in our intuitive abilitiesfor making crucial decisions in work and life can do us in. The fact is you’reprobably not as effective at making decisions as you could be. Nobody is.

But we can get better by learning about humanbehavioural quirks that can bring down the quality of our decisions.

Behavioural finance, the place where psychologymeets money, is increasingly becoming a very important subject for everybody.It’s no more a thing academic interest for scientists. It’s mainstream now. Theday isn’t far when awareness about human behavioural biases would become asessential as driving a car or using a computer.

If you’re reading this, I can say you’realready ahead in the game. Not the game of “who knows more” but the game whereknowing few essential ideas go a long way in reducing errors and increasing thequality of life.

Take care and keep learning.
