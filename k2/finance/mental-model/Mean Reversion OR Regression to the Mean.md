There arecertain days in everybody’s life which in spite of being ordinary remain etchedin the memory for a long time. It was 15th of December. I distinctly rememberit because I bought my car that day. The ownership of new car brought with itan excitement to take care of it which included an urge to diligently track thecar mileage. You know, boys with toys. At an average of 13 km/litre it was asatisfactory performance. However, after few weeks I started noticing that themileage numbers would go down occasionally and then come back again to thenorma 

Therewasn’t any change in my driving style or driving routes. Except the source offuel there was no other variable that could cause the variation in performance.So my hypothesis was that the quality of fuel was affecting my vehicle’sperformance. To empirically validate my theory I decided to keep track ofdifferent fuel stations where I got the petrol from.

The nexttime when I saw a dip in the mileage numbers I went to a different fuel stationand the improvement in the numbers followed. This made me conclude that myearlier fuel station was the culprit. Having discovered this, yours truly (i.e.me) proudly announced his statistical prowess to everybody and asked them toavoid that particular fuel station. 

Nowbefore I tell you the rest of the story, I’ll give you a chance to answer thisquestion – “Was my conclusion correct?”

Thesecond part of the story is where my stupidity is revealed. Not long afterdiscovering and avoiding the “dishonest fuel pump,” I started seeing thosemileage fluctuations again. Obviously my earlier deduction was flawed. So whathappened then?

DanielKahneman recounts a similar experience in his book [Thinking Fast and Slow](http://amzn.to/1cQWtPH). While teaching flight instructors he was told how the act ofpraising the pilots on a recent good performance usually resulted in a poorerperformance subsequently and vice versa. This logic goes against theconventional motivation theory that encouragement leads to improvedperformance.

Accordingto Kahneman, the flaw in their reasoning was that they had attached a causalinterpretation to the inevitable fluctuations of a random process. 

Let’s tryto understand the concept in light of my mileage counting experiment.

Thereality was that my mileage numbers were experiencing fluctuations due torandomness and there didn’t exist any specific pattern. Even if I hadn’tchanged my fuel station, I would have seen the mileage numbers improving anywaybecause the numbers were simply fluctuating around a mean. This phenomenon iscalled Mean Reversion. It’s a mental model from the field of statistics.

Reversionto the mean says that an event that is not average will be followed by an eventthat is closer to the average. I was suffering from the tendency to attributemeaning to a phenomenon governed only by chance. 

Hereis an interesting insight from the book [Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences](http://amzn.to/1cv3YLn) – 

…very intelligent people can be expected to have intelligentoffspring, but in general the offspring will not be as intelligent as theparents. A similar tendency toward the average or mean holds for the childrenof very short parents, who are likely to be short, but not as short as theirparents. If I throw twenty darts at a target and manage to hit the bull’s-eyeeighteen times, the next time I throw twenty darts, I probably won’t do aswell. This phenomenon leads to nonsense when people attribute the regression tothe mean to some particular scientific law, rather than to the natural behaviorof any random quantity.

NassimTaleb in his book [Fooledby Randomness](http://amzn.to/13qx7wi) observes –

“The ‘hot hand in basketball’ is another example of misperception ofrandom sequences: It is very likely in a large sample of players for one ofthem to have an inordinately lengthy lucky streak. As a matter of fact it isvery unlikely that an unspecified player somewhere doesn’t have an inordinatelylengthy lucky streak. This is a manifestation of the mechanism calledregression to the mean….in real life, the larger the deviation from the norm,the larger the probability of it coming from luck rather than skills…This canbe easily verified in stories of very prominent people in trading rapidlyreverting to obscurity, like the heroes I used to watch in trading rooms.

Let’s seesome of the areas where mean reversion wreaks havoc. Okay not havoc per say butit does raise some serious concerns about our decisions.

 

Your Doctor’s Secret Weapon

Let meintroduce you to my friend Mr. Irrational, a figment of my imagination,inspired by Ben Graham’s Mr. Market. You will be hearing a lot of stories abouthim in coming weeks. 

So Mr.Irrational isn’t keeping well and his body has been home to the common coldvirus for past few days. But the good news is that his immune system is strongenough to fight the virus and heal itself, although this healing processusually takes few days. 

After twodays of discomfort, right when his body is on the verge of bouncing back tonormal healthy state, Mr. Irrational decides to visit his doctor, Dr. Placebo.Now Dr. Placebo is afflicted by another kind of behavioural anomaly called “Dosomething Bias” but let’s save that story for another day. 

Dr.Placebo prescribes a mild antibiotic drug, which is quite unnecessary in thiscase. The very next day Mr. Irrational is back to normal, healthy as a horse.He concludes, irrationally of course, that Dr. Placebo has the ability to cureany disease in a single day. 

Theinherent randomness present in the natural process of falling sick and healingback makes it an obvious candidate for mean reversion. Alas! Mr. Irrationalhasn’t heard about mean reversion.

 

Scope of Mean Reversion

It’s veryimportant to understand that reversion to the mean is meaningful only in thoseactivities or situations where there is some element of randomness involved.The intensity with which mean reversion affects an activity is directlyproportional to the element of luck controlling the outcome in that activity.

So if youare looking at something like professional swimming and recording the lap timefor Michael Phelps, it won’t be a revelation that the outcome (lap timings)stays pretty much consistent with very little scope for reversion to the mean. 

Sportslike swimming or chess are activities where luck plays relatively small role.They are dominated by skill resulting in a very consistent and predictableoutcomes. I am not saying that all sports enjoy the same level ofpredictability. Games like Cricket, Basketball and especially many other teamsports have quite a bit of luck dictating the end result. 

When itcome to my car mileage there were myriad of factors like traffic conditions,road condition, the minor fluctuations in my driving style, the weather, windspeed etc which affected the mileage. The randomness introduced by theseenvironmental factors makes this activity prone to mean reversion.

 

Mean Reversion in Investing

You wouldagree with me that stock market investing is also one such activity where luckplays a significant role in investor’s performance. 

Considerthis typical process that many investors follow. They look at the last fewyears’ performance of a fund manager and put their money in his fund. Soon theyobserve that the fund underperforms the benchmark for next few years.Frustrated and flabbergasted, they pull out the money and find another fundmanager based on the same criteria i.e., last few years’ performance. 

The naiveinvestor is clueless why the fund performance deteriorates immediately after heputs his money into it. Mean reversion buddy!

In stockmarket periods of above average performance are usually followed by belowaverage returns and periods of below average performance are typically followedby above average returns.

Everyvalue investor loves to quote Buffett’s following statement –

Be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others aregreedy.

I smellmean reversion here. Do you?

Andthat’s why it’s essential that you shouldn’t go just by the outcome (fundperformance) of such activity. The trick is to look at the process that leadsto the outcome. Choose the process which is sound and rational.

Thesecond trick for dampening the effect of mean reversion is to take a biggersample size. Which means you shouldn’t rely on short term performance records.If you are looking at ten year performance figures of a fund then odds are highthat the fluctuations introduced by randomness and luck have evened out overlong term and what you see is a reasonable proxy for fund manager’s skill.

 

Illusion Created by Mean Reversion

So we seethat mean reversion creates two kinds of illusions. 

The firstis the illusion of cause and effect. Out inherent tendency to look for what iscausing a measurement to regress toward the mean, an exercise that isfrequently fruitless. 

Thesecond is the illusion of feedback, which makes it seem like favourablefeedback leads to worse results and unfavourable feedback leads to betterresults. 

MichaelMauboussin, author of [TheSuccess Equation](http://amzn.to/18l02c7), writes in his book – 

Understanding and using the phenomenon of reversion to the mean isessential in making sound predictions [decisions]… Reversion to the mean ismost pronounced at the extremes, so the first lesson is to recognize that whenyou see extremely good or bad results, they are unlikely to continue that way.This doesn’t mean that good results will necessarily be followed by badresults, or vice versa, but rather that the next thing that happens willprobably be closer to the average of all things that happen.

WhenI first understood the concept of mean reversion, a bulb went off in my mind.It was one of those aha moments of life. Suddenly I had an answer for a lot of unexplainedobservations around me. 

DanielKahneman, the father of behavioural economics, had a similar experience when hesaw the live performance of mean reversion. He says – 

This was a joyous moment of insight, when I saw in a new light aprinciple of statistics that I had been teaching for years.

Remember,the only reason mean reversion happens is because of randomness. Anytime youhear that mean reversion is happening because of competitive forces, decliningmoat, etc. wear your lens of mental models and then investigate further. 

Inthe current world of digital revolution and information explosion, it hasbecome increasingly important for you to build a strong bullshit filter toseparate the noise from real knowledge. Mean reversion is one such bullshit filterthat should be an important node in your latticework of mental models. 

Goeswithout saying that not every deviation from the norm is because of randomnessor mean reversion. I would like to re-iterate here that relying on just onemental model to explain everything around you is dangerous. Don’t become theman who goes on nailing every problem with his single hammer. 

Letme take the risk of being repetitive and tell you again – the best way to learn anything is toteach. I urge you to find few friends and partners with whom you can sharethese ideas. Because that’s precisely what I am doing right now, hoping that Iget a better handle on these mental models. 

Mr.Irrational joins me in bidding you goodbye till next week. Take care and keeplearning!
