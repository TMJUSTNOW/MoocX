Wikipediadefines anchoring as – Acognitive bias that describes the common human tendency to rely tooheavily on the first piece of information offered (the “anchor”) when makingdecisions. Let us understand this with several examples.

UN Members and Wheel of fortune

![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/16EAEB75-FFE1-824F-A8DA-A0FBA6BD6AFC.png)

In astudy conducted by the psychologist Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, a wheelof fortune was rigged in such a way that it will always stop at number 10 or65. After the wheel displayed either of these numbers they asked a group ofstudents to write down the number. After that, following questions were asked. 

- Is the percentage of African     nations among the UN members larger or smaller than the number you just     wrote? 
- What is your best guess of     the percentage of African nations in the UN? 

Do youthink if the number displayed in the wheel of fortune had any effect? Of courseyes!

 

Hereis the answer from  the book [Thinking Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637): 

The spin of a wheel of fortune – even one that is not rigged – cannot possibly yield usefulinformation about anything, and the participants inour experiment should simply have ignored it. But they did not ignoreit. The average estimates of those who saw 10 and 65 were 25% and 45%respectively.

Anchoringoccurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity beforeestimating the quantity. In the above example the anchor’s where either 10 or65 and the percentage of African nations among the UN members is the unknownquantity. 

₹ 17 vs ₹ 543 Stock 

Ourdesire to latch on to the wrong anchors causes us to make mistakes. A Rs 17stock could be more expensive than a Rs 543 stock. The 17-rupee one may havebillions of shares outstanding causing the aggregate market value to be veryhigh when compared with its assets, earnings, and cash flows. An IPO is notnecessarily cheap because its offered at a par value of Rs 10 When a stockhits 52-week low it is not necessarily cheap (although it may be a good placeto look for value). Don’t sell a stock simply because it hit all-time-high.After all, all 20-baggers would have hit all-time-high long before they became20-baggers.

Anchor tointrinsic value, not to absolute price, par value, 52-week lows, or all-timehighs. You do need anchors in life, but get the right ones to avoid sinking…

 

Stock is cheap; selling 50% below the 52 week high

I used toanalyze the stock in the following way.

1. Look at the     52 week high price for the stock.
2. Look at the current price.
3. If the current price is     selling way below the 52 week high price I consider it as a bargain

Why did Ido that? I got anchored to the 52 week high price. Does it matter? No. It is anirrelevant piece of information. What matters is if the stock price is sellingbelow its intrinsic value.

Height of Tallest Redwood Tree

Inanother example, people were asked the following questions:

- Is the height of the tallest     redwood more or less than 1,200 feet? 
- What is your best guess about     the height of the tallest redwood? 

Thesequestions were answered by a group of participants, with a mean estimate of 844feet for the second question, which is about three times the actual height of avery tall redwood.

Adifferent group was given the same second question, but the height value infirst question was changed from 1,200 feet to 180 feet. The results from thissecond group illustrate the powerful effects of anchoring bias, as the meanestimate fell to 282 feet.

Ratherthan try to reason that a 1,200 foot tree would approximate a 120 storybuilding, people assume that there must be some factual basis to thehypothetical height value, so they adjust their estimates accordingly.

Anchors at work

I am asoftware engineer. I get requests for estimating the scope of the project. Theconversation will look something like this.

- Other   – Will this     project take 2 weeks?
- Me       –     No.
- Other   – How long will     this project take?
- Me       –     3 weeks.

Did Ireally think? No, I got anchored with 2 weeks.

 

 

Causes of Anchoring Bias

Anchoringcan be produced by 2 different mechanisms.

1. Deliberate     Adjustment.
2. Priming.

Deliberate Adjustment

DeliberateAdjustment is an act of System 2. What is System 2? Try to compute the value of18 * 19. Whatever happened inside your head to solve this problem is an act ofSystem 2. It needs to be brought into attention consciously ordeliberately. Imagine you are driving in an highway at 70 mph and talking toyour friends. You are taking the exit to drive in the city streets which has aspeed limit of 30 mph.  You will reduce your speed but you will not adjustenough. From the book [Thinking Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637)

Insufficient adjustment is a failure of a weak or lazy System2. Start from an anchoring number, assess whether it is too high or toolow, and gradually adjust your estimate by mentally moving from the anchor. Theadjustment typically ends prematurely, because people stop when they are nolonger certain that they should move farther.

Priming Effect

Suggestionis a priming effect. It is caused by System 1. What is System 1? Listeningto music is a System 1 activity. You should be able to do some other tasksalong with that. Consider the following questions

1. Was Gandhi     more or less than 144 years old when he died?
2. How old was Gandhi when he     died?

Didyou produce your estimate by adjusting down from 144? Probably Not. Still thisabsurdly high number influenced our estimates. How can that be? Watch the video– Malcolm Gladwell talks about priming. [Video - How Primingimpacts your performance](https://youtu.be/Z_mVFPCaQJY).

 

 

What about Professionals. Do they Anchor?

Yesthey do. Real estate agents were asked to asses the value of the house that wasin the market. They visited the house and studied a comprehensive booklet ofinformation that included an asking price. Half the agents saw an asking pricethat was substantially lower and the other half saw a price that wassubstantially higher. What estimates did they come up with? Here is theanswer from  the book ‘[Thinking Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637)‘

They insisted that the listing price had no effect on theirresponses, but they were wrong; the anchoring effect was 41%. Indeed, theprofessionals were almost as susceptible to anchoring effects asbusiness school students with no real-estate experience, whose anchoring indexwas 48%. The only difference between the two groups was that the studentsconceded that they were influenced by the anchor; while the professionalsdenied that influence.

How does anchoring affect us in investing? 

Imagineyou purchased one share of Infosys for Rs 2,300. The stock is currently sellingfor Rs 1,600. Will you sell the stock? Most likely no.

Did youcome to the conclusion because the current value of the business is much higherthe selling price. Most likely the reason for not selling the stock is you gotanchored to the purchase price of Rs 2,300.

Most ofus analyze the stock in the following way…

1. Look at the     52-week high price for the stock 
2. Look at the current price 
3. If the current price is     selling way below the 52-week high price we consider it as a bargain 

We areanchoring ourselves to the 52-week high. Does it matter? No!

A stock’shistorical price is an irrelevant piece of information when you are looking tomake a decision today. What matters is whether the stock is selling below itsintrinsic value as calculated now. Another example of anchoring bias comes frommy own examples of avoiding Asian Paints and selling early Page Industries.

In 2003,just after I had joined my job as an equity analyst, I started reading on AsianPaints and immediately liked the business. It was a simple business, withamazing financial performance and clean balance sheet.

The stockwas trading then at around Rs 300 and my analysis told me that it was anattractive investment at that price.

Then,madness happened! In a week’s time, the stock moved up around 10% to Rs 330. Itold myself, “Oh, it has already risen 10%! Let me buy when it falls back to Rs300.” I was anchored to Rs 300!

The stockdid not fall, but kept rising and rising, and with each rise, my “anchor” alsoshifted higher – “Oh it has risen another 20%…and then another 30%!” 

The stockhas multiplied almost 16 times since then, and I am still waiting for that Rs300!

Then,consider Page Industries, which I was “smart” enough to buy at Rs 300 in early2009. The stock moved up beyond my expectations, and I anchored to my purchaseprice of Rs 300, sold it for Rs 1,200 in late 2010. I had after all multipliedmy money 4x over Rs 300. Again, I was anchored to my purchase price and forgotto consider the company’s increased intrinsic value that made the stockattractive even at Rs 1,200.

At thetime of writing this, Page is trading at around Rs 4,200…or 3x from when I soldit!

You mightthink that all this seems good in hindsight, but that’s not the point here.These stocks may have moved down after I had avoided or sold them, but thepoint I am making here is that my decision to avoid Asian Paints and sell PageIndustries was driven my anchors…which were these stocks’s prices.

Instead,the better anchors would have been their intrinsic values at the time I wasmaking the decisions.

 

What does Warren Buffet do?

Anyways,anchoring bias is an easy one to fall into, but here’s something you can learnfrom Warren Buffett who avoids falling into the anchoring bias using a simpletechnique.

Ashe wrote in one of his shareholder letters, Buffett doesn’t look at the stock price when he’s evaluating acompany. He reads the annual report of the company, understands the businessand values it. Once the valuation is done, he looks at the price. If it isselling below the value then he buys it. He does understand the effects ofanchoring!

 

Keep in Mind

1. Price paid     is irrelevant information. The only useful information is the current     value.
2. If you are asked for an     estimate, take time to think. Sleep over it. There is always tomorrow.
