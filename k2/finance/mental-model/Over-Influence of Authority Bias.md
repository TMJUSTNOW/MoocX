This isthe human tendency to follow orders blindly from an authority, even in thecases when the authority could be wrong.

All of ushave obeyed to authorities at some points in our life. We all have done that toour parents, teachers and policemen. Obedience to authority is definitelyneeded.

Ourparents taught us how to be disciplined and respectful to others. Teacherstaught us to read and write. Policemen provide us safety. So obeyingauthorities is a way to show respect to what they do.

Butblindly following an “authority” can result in serious problems, like thefollowing examples suggest.

Why arewe so susceptible to following orders? It has to do with our culture and theway humans has formed societies. 'Living in dominance hierarchies as he does,like all his ancestors before him, man was born mostly to follow leaders, withonly a few people doing the leading. And so, human society is formallyorganized into dominance hierarchies, with their culture augmenting the naturalfollow-the-leader tendency of man.'

Milgram Experiment Shock Experiment

“More Hideous crimes have been committed in the name of obediencethan in the name of rebellion.” - C.P. SNOW

Throughouthistory, the plea “I was only following orders” has been offered to excuseactions carried out on behalf of orders that were foolish,destructive, orillegal. 

 

We areconditioned to blindly accept authority. After all mom is always right isn’tit?

Example - Hospital Experiment - Cialdini's Influence

Example - Execution of Officers who worked for Hitler

A wrongauthority figure, if followed, can cause untold misery. That's what happenedwhen Hitler took over Germany. Many officers that were tried post-war claimedimmunity because they were only following orders. Of course, that didn'tconvince the judges and most of the convicted offenders were executed.

Example - Mr. Market

Mr.Buffett has correctly called stock market as a “semi-psychotic creature givento extremes of elation and despair.”

However,the vast majority of people, and academic ﬁnance in particular, treat marketprices as correct and give it the respect reserved for authority ﬁgures....

 

Buffettwrites the following about Ben Graham’s “Mr. Market” metaphor in his book, “TheIntelligent Investor”:

 

“BenGraham explained why in Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor. There heintroduced “Mr. Market,” an obliging fellow who shows up everyday to either buyfrom you or sell to you, whichever you wish. The more manic-depressive thischap is, the greater the opportunities available to the investor. That's truebecause a wildly ﬂuctuating market means that irrationally low prices willperiodically be attached to solid businesses. It is impossible to see how theavailability of such prices can be thought of as increasing the hazards for aninvestor who is totally free to either ignore the market or exploit its folly.”

 

By givingtoo much importance to Mr. Market, most investors make a fundamental mistake ofconverting their basic strength into a weakness

 

The Jonestown Massacre 

[The Jonestown Massacre ](http://k2invest.blogspot.in/2016/01/the-jonestown-massacre.html)

 Jim Cramers and Bear Searns

[Jim Cramer and Bear Stearns](http://k2invest.blogspot.in/2016/01/jim-cramer-and-bear-stearns.html)

From Bear Stearns to Suzlon 

Watchthese two videos on what an “authority” has to say on India’s leading windpower company, Suzlon. The first video was shot three years back when Suzlonwas at Rs 78, and the second one year back when the stock was at Rs 28.

The stockis now under Rs 10!

Video1 - [Buy Suzlon, says SP Tulsian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSUscDt2xNQ) 

Video2 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZyWkTSk3E&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZyWkTSk3E&feature=youtu.be)      

 

Now thatSuzlon has crashed over these years is not the big idea here. The big idea isthat I have seen several investors buying the stock just because an “expert” or“authority” had recommended it on CNBC.

 

The More You Don’t Understand…

…the moreyou would believe the authority.

Hereis what Charlie Munger said in his speech on “The Psychology of Human Misjudgment”…

Experts are sometimes more convincing when we don’t understand them.Sometimes we are too impressed by something that sounds clever. For example,some people buy into investments just because they don’t understand them. Theyassume it must be something unique. As Warren Buffett says, “Techniquesshrouded in mystery clearly have value to the purveyor of investment advice.After all, what witch doctor has ever achieved fame and fortune by simplyadvising ‘Take two aspirins’?

Like,look at this video that was shot at the time of SKS Microfinance’s IPO. Giventhe anchor’s authoritative looks, voice, clothes, and words, it was easy forany gullible investor to fall prey to the stupid things (in terms of sensibleinvesting) he was talking about. And many did!

 

 

Givespecial attention to words like “expensive but justifiable”, and “will forevertrade expensive”…and you will see the authoritativeness surround you from allsides. It’s another matter that SKS is down almost 90% since its IPO threeyears back.

India’s Own Madoffs

 

The Pied Pier of Hamlyn was a very charming authority ﬁgure and whenhe cast his spell, everyone followed. The consequences for following for thisblind obedience were not good.There have been many pied pipers in ﬁnancialhistory…

 

Ponzi schemes aren’t a western world phenomenon. We in India havehad a history of Madoffs appearing at regular intervals, duping people ofmillions, and then getting caught. 

The only difference here is that these fraudsters in India remainunpunished for years, which motivates many others like them to perpetratesimilar crimes.

Take the case of Ketan Parikh, Harshad Mehta, or Citibank’s ShivrajPuri – all have defraudedpeople for crores of rupees.

 

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/BFF9F851-B5BC-784E-A5E5-F008B780C1CE.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H99fMznciIs/Vn5q_fRIpmI/AAAAAAAA5Vw/0ehOml0JFXA/s1600/ShivrajPuriCitibankFraudster.png)

All these people were considered authorities in their own light, andthis helped them make fools out of investors for a long-long time, before theywere caught. Ketan Parikh, for instance, was described as the Pied Piper ofDalal Street. He was a Chartered Accountant by profession, and came from afamily of brokers. In late 1990s, he formed a network of brokers and identified10 stocks that got popularized as “K-10 stocks”.

He manipulated the prices of these stocks, and people thought thegains were for real and would continue till eternity. This was also the time ofthe dotcom bubble, which compounded money for people in a very short time. So alot of people borrowed money to speculate in stocks, especially those from theK-10 group.

In 2000, after the dotcom bubble burst and the stock market crashed,the K-10 stocks also went down. Ketan Parikh faced liquidity problems and thebrokers started pressuring him for payment. He got behind the bars, but onlyafter causing thousands of Indian investors to lose their savings.

“All my lifetime’s savings are gone. I don’t know how to feed myfamily,” rued a small investor hit by the Ketan Parikh scam.

 

Evaluating Management 

When evaluating management beware of the authority. You may thinkthey know better, but very often they don’t.

 

They are just too close to the situation. They often miss the BIGPICTURE, which a mature seasoned security analyst can have.

 

See “Biased Assimilation and Attitude Polarization.” - People tooclose to a situation experience noise which mis-inﬂuences them.

 

Keep you skeptical hat on when you meet management. And don’t forgetto carry a few pinches of salt...

Over Influence of Authority in Corporations 

In corporations: Many corporations suffer from this tendency whenthe top boss may be completely wrong but his subordinates fear telling himabout his mistakes. Says Munger, 'So strong is undue respect for authority thatthis CEO, and many even worse examples, have actually been allowed to remain incontrol of important business institutions for long periods after it was clearthey should be removed. The obvious implication: Be careful whom you appoint topower because a dominant authority figure will often be hard to remove, aidedas he will be by the authority-misinfluence tendency.'

 

Learning from Feynman

In the book [ThePleasures of Finding Things Out](http://bit.ly/15pQe9q), Richard Feynmanwrites…

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/35EF81B4-0B7B-DF47-8B0F-7E13AFB2B081.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CN48m1mw6l0/VoYe1qVPLEI/AAAAAAAA5zI/oS4RMXfxzkc/s1600/richard_feyman.jpg)

We get experts on everything that sound likethey’re sort of scientific experts. They’re not scientific, they sit at atypewriter and they make up something like, oh, food grown with fertilizerthat’s organic is better for your than food grown with fertilizer that’sinorganic – may be true, may be not true, but it hasn’t been demonstrated oneway or the other. But they’ll sit there on the typewriter and make up all thisstuff as if it’s science and then become expert on foods, organic foods and soon. There’s all kinds of myths and pseudoscience all over the place.

Science alone of all the subjects contains within itself the lessonof the danger of belief in the infallibility of the greatest teachers in thepreceding generation... Learn from science that you must doubt the experts. Asa matter of fact, I can also define science another way: Science is the beliefin the ignorance of experts.- Feynman

“There are 60,000 economists in the U.S., many of them employedfull-time trying to forecast recessions and interest rates, and if they coulddo it successfully twice in a row, they'd all be millionaires by now...as faras I know, most of them are still gainfully employed, which ought to tell ussomething.” - Peter Lynch, One Up On Wall Street

 

We make no attempt to predict how security marketswill behave; successfully forecasting short term stock price movements issomething we think neither we nor anyone else can do. - Warren Buffett

Like a Don Juan or a Casanova, the chartist has anunending series of short affairs with stocks. First there is observation, awatching of the head and shoulders, the neckline, and the shape of the bottom.Flirtation may involve some resistance or some support. As involvementincreases, congestion builds. There may be penetration of old tops, or aviolation of former lows.These give way to mounting excitement and then climax,followed by the warm afterglow of proﬁt taking. – Burton Malkiel

"The markets rise after a period ofreaccumulation is a bullish sign. Nevertheless, fulcrum characteristics are notyet clearly present and a resistance area exists 40 points higher in the Dow,so it is clearly premature to say the next leg of the bull market is up. -Burton Malkiel 

“If, in the coming weeks, a test of the lows holds and the marketbreaks out of its ﬂag, a further rise would be indicated. Should the lows beviolated, a continuation of the intermediate term downturn is called for. Inview of the current situation, it is a distinct possibility that traders willsit in the wings awaiting a clearer delineation of the trend and the marketwill move in a narrow trading range." If you ask me exactly what it means,I'm afraid I cannot tell you, but I think the technician probably had thefollowing thing in mind: "If the market does not go up or down, it willremain unchanged."– Burton Malkiel

 

We believe that short- term forecasts of stock orbond prices are useless. The forecasts may tell you a great deal about theforecaster;they tell you nothing about the future.) - Buffett

Short-term market forecasts are poison and shouldbe kept locked up in a safe place, away from children and also from grown-upswho behave in the market like children. _ Buffett

We have two classes of forecasters: Thosewho don't know –and those whodon't know they dont know –Galbraith.

We will continue to ignore political and economic forecasts, whichare an expensive distraction for many investors and businessmen.

 

Thirty years ago, no one could have foreseen the huge expansion ofthe Vietnam War, wage and price controls, two oil shocks,the resignation of apresident, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a one-day drop in the Dow of508 points, or treasury bill yields ﬂuctuating between 2.8% and 17.4%.

 

But, surprise - none of these blockbuster events made the slightestdent in Ben Grahams investment principles. Nor did they render unsound thenegotiated purchases of ﬁne businesses at sensible prices. Imagine the cost tous, then, if we had let a fear of unknowns cause us to defer or alter thedeployment of capital. Indeed, we have usually made our best purchases whenapprehensions about some macro event were at a peak. Fear is the foe of thefaddist, but the friend of the fundamentalist.

 

Social Proof + Authority (predictions by experts),

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/A8FDD36A-8AE3-5E46-9F98-77D74BAD5E0A.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-34vOQVLa84M/VoBeYq9ZI-I/AAAAAAAA5hU/X3MD_COf78I/s1600/Philip_E_Tetlock.png)

Tetlock is the fella who demonstrated the lunacy of the idea of most“experts” in social science...

 

People who make prediction their business— people who appear as experts on television, get quoted in newspaperarticles, advise governments and businesses, and participate in punditry roundtables—are no better than the rest of us. When they’re wrong, they’re rarelyheld accountable, and they rarely admit it,either. They insist that they werejust off on timing, or blindsided by an improbable event, or almost right, orwrong for the right reasons.

Fox vs Hedgehog 

[Fox or Hedgehog Story](http://k2invest.blogspot.in/2015/12/fox-or-hedgehog-story.html)

 

 

 

Keep in Mind

The “Is this authority truly an expert?” question can be veryvaluable in helping you avoid getting over-influenced by someone who looks likean authority but isn’t. The question would impel you to distinguish betweenrelevant authorities and irrelevant authorities. And this is a distinction thatis easy to forget when the push of authority pressure is combined with the rushof modern life.

In the busy-ness of our daily lives, we often forget to look at theincentives of people who pose as authorities, because we simply go by how theylook and what they talk…like what we see on business channels.

But it’s important to doubt the experts, and especially when theyare offering you stock advice.

Do not buy or sell stocks just because an “authority” figuresuggested on CNBC or any other business channel or other media.

Also, note that if someone is an authority in one field, it does notmean that he is an authority in every field. It is better to avoid Haloeffects.

Finally, always remember what Nassim Taleb said…

In some disciplines, ‘expert’ is the closest thingto a fraud performing no better than a computer using a simple algorithm.
