Definition

This isthe tendency of humans to be misled because of prior associations. Thisbehaviour, says Munger, is a 'responsive behavior, creating a new habit, isdirectly triggered by rewards previously bestowed.' Take the example of a manbuying a branded shoe polish. He has a good experience with it, and because ofthis experience he buys the same shoe polish when he needs another. 

A commonform of influence from association comes from something we are well aware of.This is called blanket stereotyping. For example, if someone is a Punjabi, weassume that he will be a hearty eater; if a Bengali, he should be cultured inthe arts; if a South Indian, he must be brainy; if an Indian, he must beargumentative in nature.

 

When Iwas working on my job as an analyst, sometime during 2007, a colleague of minemade it a point to wear a specific light blue shirt to all management meetings.

WhenI asked him the reason, he mentioned that whenever he did that – wore a light blue shirt to meetings – andthen wrote a recommendation report on a stock, that stock usually turned out tobe a good pick.

It wasonly in 2008 that he realized that it was not the shirt but the madness in thestock market that turned any stock he wrote about into a good performer!

Then, in2009, just before he was about to get married and went to buy a jewellery forhis to-be wife, he bought something that was way beyond his budget. He laterconfessed that he had simply associated that expensive gift with how amazing itlooked on the beautiful salesgirl, and he thought that it would look equallygood on his future wife.

 

Our ‘Associative” Brain

You see,in the daily course of our lives, we feel pleasure or pain depending on thestimuli we receive from different sources: things, situations, people or theenvironment.

We tendto associate stimuli with past experiences, with values and tendencies we havelearned.

We movetoward stimuli we associate with pleasure. We move way from stimuli weassociate with pain. That is the way we have been learning since we werechildren.

It is afact, not a mere opinion or theory. I will prove it in the followings lines.

Whetherwe realize or not, we can be influenced by associating a person, product orservice, with something we like. Most of the time, we purchase products justbecause we connect them with something we like or something that is in linewith our values and habits.

Thismental process (bias from mere association) runs unnoticed by us because it isrunning in our subconscious mind.

Thesubconscious mind holds the most emotional memories (positives and negatives)we have had through our life. We remember easily emotional events andexperiences.

Stop fora minute, watch out carefully the picture below and ask to yourself thefollowing question:

Why docar manufacturers associate their cars with beautiful female models? (It is avisible, common pattern among all cars manufacturer…just visit an auto show andyou will know!)

Watch outthese models along with the high performance racing car…

Orlook at this picture of Bollywood actor John Abraham – known for his biking skills – posing for a bike promotion…

Is it amere coincidence? I do not think so. Marketers are like psychologists who knowhow people’s mind works! They know how to encourage us to move toward somethingthey want to sell us!

Fewpeople in a modern society do not associate sport cars with young, beautifulmodels or super-bikes with famous bikers. The underlying message associatedwith the advertising, in plain English, is – “If you want to ride like John Abraham, you have to buy thisbike”.

Well,undoubtedly its underlying message is so attracting for men. They want to fixin people’s mind the association between their brand and something we like.

Why we associate?

Inthe [introduction](http://www.safalniveshak.com/mastermind-value-investing-psychology-of-investing/) of this module onbehavioural biases, I had written about the reflexive and reflective parts inour brain. 

Thereflexive part operates very quickly and makes us to react instantaneously tostimuli, good or bad.

Thereflective brain is slow and you require extraordinary mental effort to use it.It is lazy and gets tired very soon. You use this when you try to calculate 18* 39.

Most ofour associations happen in the reflexive brain, where instant reactions areproduced.

Is thisbad? No!

In orderto navigate the complex world with information all around us, we need to takedecisions effortlessly and that is what reflexive brain is good at. Usingreflective brain for everything is impossible as it gets tired.

But thereflexive brain is full of biases and it jumps to conclusions very easily. Ifyou are taking life-changing decisions, then you are better off using thereflective brain.

Rememberthis when investing your hard earned money in stocks.

Here is areal-life example of bias from mere association working in the stock market. 

Inthe book [Your Money andYour Brain](http://bit.ly/17ERiIg), Jason Zweig writes…

In the late 1990s day traders got a buzz simply from sitting down infront of their computers if the previous day’s trades had made money. And whenCisco Systems had beaten Wall Street’s earnings forecasts by exactly one pennyper share for ten calendar quarters in a row, just the approach of the next ofits next earnings announcement made investors feel euphoric.

In the five days leading up to its earnings release in February2000, Cisco’s stock jumped 10.5% on trading volume more than one-third heavierthan normal. This Pavlovian price rise was driven by investors salivating overthe earnings announcement they knew was coming.

Whathappened in the end?

Ciscosystems lost roughly US$400 billion in stock market value – the biggest declinein the financial history.

Here aresome other stock market examples where “bias from mere association” comes intoplay… Since 2008, most investors (speculators) who have lost money in realestate stocks think all companies from the sector are bad (which is largelytrue).

 

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/3FBC35F1-7FEC-0B49-A0D6-6F8D7661152E.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CLAEFwG0pz4/Vn5bjuvr5sI/AAAAAAAA5S4/6U7WFsJGxWE/s1600/association_bias-realestate-schart.png)

Then, asI write, most FMCG stocks are trading at their lifetime high valuations becauseinvestors are seeking comfort in the safety of balance sheets of FMCGcompanies. While most FMCG companies do have safe balance sheets, “most” isdifferent from “all”.

Also, Isee a lot of investors lapping up to pharma companies assuming that adepreciating rupee will give a huge boost to their profits. While this may be acorrect assumption fundamentally, what is worrying that investors tend to beassociating “all” pharma stocks to do well in a depreciating rupee scenario.Well, some may not (and for their own reasons)!

Finally,companies change their names to match a hot theme and thus fool investors intothe association bias. Like in 2000, several companies added “sys” or “tech” atthe end of their names, and investors flocked to them considering them the nextbig things! In 2006-07, several companies added “projects” or “infra” to theirnames, and benefited from the madness around! Keep in Mind

Whileavoiding associations is very hard, here are a few antidotes to save you…

- Measure people, things and     situations on their own merits and not because they belong to a certain     category or group. 
- An individual is not good or     bad because we associate them with positive or negative stimuli. 
- Experiences are context     dependent. The same experience with in another context can produce a     different result. 
- If you want to stop certain     behavior, associate it with negative stimuli. 

Finally,always remember what Mark Twain said…

We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdomthat is in it – and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hotstove lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove lid again – and that is well;but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.

How to avoid Association Bias

Munger'sprescription to avoid the mere-association tendency is pure genius. 'To avoidbeing misled by the mere association of some fact with past success, use thismemory clue. Think of Napoleon and Hitler when they invaded Russia after usingtheir armies with much success elsewhere.'

Hefurther elaborates, 'The proper antidotes to being made such a patsy by pastsuccess are (1) to carefully examine each past success, looking for accidental,non-causative factors associated with such success that will tend to mislead asone appraises odds implicit in a proposed new undertaking and (2) to look fordangerous aspects of the new undertaking that were not present when pastsuccess occurred.'

 

Impact of Association Bias

Oftenfound in: Classifying products, brands or persons

In Life 

In Life:Take the association with price, for example. What do we normally tend to thinkabout a product if it is priced higher? We think that the it offers betterquality. Munger warns against this. 'Knowing this, some seller of an ordinaryindustrial product will often change his product's trade dress and raise itsprice significantly, hoping that quality-seeking buyers will be tricked intobecoming purchasers by mere association of his product and its high price. Thisindustrial practice frequently is effective in driving up sales and even moreso in driving up profits... With luxury goods, the process works with a specialboost because buyers who pay high prices often gain extra status from thusdemonstrating both their good taste and their ability to pay.'

Lovecauses a powerful influence- from-mere-association tendency. People tend to getblind in love. Often mothers of convicted killers grieve with conviction aboutthe innocence of their sons. Says Munger, 'People disagree about how muchblindness should accompany the association called love. In Poor Richard'sAlmanack, Franklin counseled: 'Keep your eyes wide open before marriage andhalf shut thereafter'. Perhaps this 'eyes-half-shut' solution is about right,but I favor a tougher prescription: See it like it is and love anyway.'

In corporations 

Incorporations: Corporations extensively employ this tendency. Says Munger,'Advertisers know about the power of mere association. You won't see Cokeadvertise alongside some account of the death of a child. Instead, Coke adspicture life as happier than reality.' Many aspiring brands utilise star powerto sell their products.

Mungercites how the Persian messenger syndrome also affects corporations to causehuge losses. 'CBS, in its late heyday, was famous for occurrence of the Persianmessenger syndrome because Chairman Paley was hostile to people who brought himbad news. The result was that Paley lived in a cocoon of unreality, from whichhe made one bad deal after another, even exchanging a large share of CBS for acompany that had to be liquidated shortly thereafter.'

'Theproper antidote to the Persian messenger syndrome and its bad effects is todevelop, through exercise of will, a habit of welcoming bad news. At Berkshire,there is a common injunction: Always tell us the bad news promptly. It is onlythe good news that can wait.'
