This isthe tendency of humans to deny reality just to avoid pain. Denial is a commonoccurrence in the cases of tragedies. Not able to accept a tragic outcome, wetend to refute the fact that the tragedy has occurred. Charlie Munger cites theexample of a son of a family friend, 'This phenomenon first hit me hard inWorld War II when the superathlete, superstudent son of a family friend flewoff over the Atlantic Ocean and never came back. His mother, who was a verysane woman, then refused to believe he was dead. That's simple, pain-avoidingpsychological denial.'

 

I callthis the “Dam Fools” Model - Pain Reducing Psychological Denial.

Thisfrom Jared Diamond:

“Thelast reason that I shall mention for irrational failure to try to solve aperceived problem is psychological denial. This is a technical term with aprecisely defined meaning in individual psychology, and it has been taken overinto the pop culture. If something that you perceive arouses an unbearablypainful emotion, you may subconsciously suppress or deny your perception inorder to avoid the unbearable pain, even though the practical results ofignoring your perception may prove ultimately disastrous. The emotions mostoften responsible are terror, anxiety, and sadness. Typical examples includerefusing to think about the likelihood that your husband, wife, child, or bestfriend may be dying, because the thought is so painfully sad, or else blockingout a terrifying experience. For example, consider a narrow deep river valleybelow a high dam, such that if the dam burst, the resulting ﬂood of water woulddrown people for a long distance downstream. When attitude pollsters ask peopledownstream of the dam how concerned they are about the dams bursting, its notsurprising that fear of a dam burst is lowest far downstream, and increasesamong residents increasingly close to the dam. Surprisingly, though, when onegets within a few miles of the dam, where fear of the dams breaking is highest,as you then get closer to the dam the concern falls off to zero! That is, thepeople living immediately under the dam who are certain to be drowned in a damburst profess unconcern. That is because of psychological denial: the only wayof preserving ones sanity while living immediately under the high dam is todeny the ﬁnite possibility that it could burst.”

 

Thereis much denial in the world of business. Witness what’s happening in thebanking sector right now.

“Ithink its in the nature of things for some businesses to die. Its also in thenature of things that in some cases, you shouldn’t fight it...

 

“There’s no logical answer in some cases except to wring the moneyout and go elsewhere. And that’s very tough for managements to do. In fact,theyalmost never face up to that. It’s very rare.” — Munger.

“Idon't want you to think we have anyway of learning or behaving so you wont makemistakes. I'm just saying that you can learn to make fewer mistakes thanother people - and how to ﬁx mistakes faster when you do make them...

 

“Butthere's no way you can live an adequate life without making many mistakes.

 

Infact, one trick in life is to get so you can handle mistakes. Failure to handle psychological denial is a common way for people to go broke...

 

“You'vemade an enormous commitment to something. The more the effort and money you’ve poured in, themore the whole consistencyprinciple makes you think: "Now it has to work, IfI put in just a little more, then it'll work.“ [Contrast- boiling frog]

 

Anddeprival super-reactionsyndrome also comes in: You're going to lose the wholething if you don't put in a little more. People go broke that way -because they cant stop and rethink and say: "I can afford to writethis one off and live to ﬁght again. I don’t have to pursue this thing as an obsession - in away that will break me...

 

Partof what you must learn is to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds. Life, in part, is like a poker game,wherein you have to learn to quit sometime whenholding a much-loved hand.” 

 

Impact of Psychological Denial Bias

Oftenfound in: Instances of loss, death, drug abuse

In Life 

InLife: How does simple, pain-avoidance psychological denial play out in reallife? Munger explains, 'The reality is too painful to bear, so one distorts thefacts until they become bearable. We all do that to some extent, often causingterrible problems. The tendency's most extreme outcomes are usually mixed upwith love, death, and chemical dependency.'

Drugaddicts or excessive drinkers similarly undergo this process of denial. SaysMunger, 'Addicted persons tend to believe that they remain in respectablecondition, with respectable prospects. They thus display an extremelyunrealistic denial of reality as they go deeper and deeper intodeterioration... One should stay far away from any conduct at all likely todrift into chemical dependency. Even a small chance of suffering so great adamage should be avoided.'
