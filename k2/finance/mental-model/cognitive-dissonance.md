I amsure many of you have heard the famous Aesop’s fable about the fox and thegrapes. If not, here’s a quick recap of the story.

A foxsees some high-hanging grapes and wishes to eat them. When it is unable tothink of a way to reach them, it decides that the grapes are not worth eating.The fox then justifies that the grapes are not ripe or they are sour (hence thecommon phrase ‘sour grapes’).

Everytime I hear this story, I laugh at the delusional fox. However, I rarelyimagine that a similar fox is inside me also. The fable is a classicillustration of what psychologists call Cognitive Dissonance.

Behaviouralscientists define cognitive dissonance as the feeling of mental discomfortor tension produced by the combined presence of two thoughts, ideas,beliefs, attitudes, or opinions that are psychologically inconsistent. Thegreater the discomfort, the greater the desire to reduce the dissonance of thetwo cognitive elements. Dissonance theory suggests that if individuals act inways that contradict their beliefs, then they typically will change their beliefs to align with theiractions.

In caseof Aesop’s fox, an inconsistency arose when the fox set out to do something andfailed to accomplish it. He could resolve this conflict in one of three ways:(a) by somehow getting at the grapes, (b) by admitting that his skills areinsufficient, or (c) by reinterpreting what happened retrospectively. The lastoption is an example of cognitive dissonance, or, rather, its resolution.

Thecognitive dissonance theory was developed in 1957 by Leon Festinger, whoobserved in a series of experiments that people would change their attitudes tomake them more consistent with actions they had just taken. Cognitivedissonance is one of many behavioural biases that evolution has wired intothe human brain.

In theancient hunter-gatherer environment, if a man saw something vague it wasimportant for him to get rid of the doubt (whether it was a harmless rabbit ora dangerous panther) immediately. A quick decision was essential for survival.This trait gave an evolutionary advantage to human beings.

Butevolution is a slow process and it hasn’t caught up with the rapid changes inour environment. In the modern world, there are hardly any such lifethreatening situations, but the brain’s hard wiring hasn’t changed much in lastfew thousand years. So we continue to take decisions under the influence ofmany of the psychological reflexes.

Smoke That Clouds The Rationality

One ofthe best examples of cognitive dissonance that you can see around is people whocontinue to smoke even after being aware of the harmful effects of smoking. Howdo they deal with this conflict between what they know and how they act?

Theywould tell themselves, “Well, I’ve tried to quit and it’s just too hard.” Or,“It’s not as bad as they say and besides, I really enjoy smoking.” And ofcourse the best one I have heard so far – “Because of smoking, I get a chanceto take deep breaths. And deep breathing is good for health.” This is downrighthilarious!

Habitualsmokers justify their behaviours either through rationalizations or throughdenials, just as most people do when faced with cognitive dissonance. And it’sjust insane when you see doctors themselves suffering from this. Nassim Taleb,in his book [Fooled byRandomness](http://amzn.to/1N6UIO5), writes –

…the best way to understand how we could be rational in ourperception of risks and probabilities and, at the same time, be foolish whileacting on them would be to have a conversation with a cigarette smoker. For fewsmokers remain unaware of the lung cancer rates in their population. If youremain unconvinced, take a look at the huddling smoking crowd outside theservice entrance of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New YorkCity’s Upper East Side. You will see dozens of cancer nurses (and, perhaps,doctors) standing outside the entrance with a cigarette in hand as hopelesspatients are wheeled in for their treatment.

Noticethe pattern – one desiressomething, finds it unattainable, and reduces his dissonance (psychologicaldiscomfort) by criticizing it. In simple terms, it’s nothing but a lie that wekeep telling ourselves and it’s so sad that all this while we’re aware thatit’s a lie. But it’s not very uncommon.

Ifyou think above comic strip is funny, there’s a company called Zappos, asubsidiary of Amazon, which uses the insights from cognitive dissonance toboost the job satisfaction in employees. Dan Ariely, author of PredictablyIrrational, explains Zappos’ trick in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFYPlXGiJ-E) –

In Investing

Considerthis common phenomenon which every investor has experienced at least once.Immediately after buying a stock, an investor comes under a strongpsychological force called endowment effect which states that when youown something, a stock in this case, you start to value it more. Any positiveinformation related to the stock validates his initial purchase decision and hetends to give more weight to such confirming evidence (confirmation bias).

Anysubsequent drop in the stock price because of negative news give rise tothe possibility that his or her initial decision was wrong. This creates acognitive dissonance in investor’s mind and the way he typically resolves it bybuying more to remain consistent with his original commitment rather thanrationally re-evaluating his earlier decision in the light of new facts.

Thefamous Canadian economist John Kenneth Galbraith understood this verywell. He stated –

Faced with the choice between changing one’s mind and proving thatthere is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.

CharlieMunger has another term for this bias – Doubt AvoidanceTendency. Munger explains this with a brilliantanalogy. He explains this with a brilliant analogy. He says human brainworks like a human egg. When a sperm gets into a human egg, there’s anautomatic shut-off device that bars any other sperm from getting in. Thisreminds me of the saying –

There is nothing more dangerous than an idea if it’s the only oneyou have.

Overcoming Cognitive Dissonance

Thefirst step is to bring the awareness that there exists a problem. As WarrenBuffett wrote in his 1991 letter to shareholders –

The most important thing to when you find yourself in a hole is tostop digging.

Recognizeand accept that you are in a hole that you have made a mistake. Don’t closeyour eyes and go into a denial mode. Understand that this behavioural bias isnothing less than self-deception. A man who has committed a mistake, saysConfucius, the Chinese philosopher, “and doesn’t correct it, is committinganother mistake.”

Thesecond step is to actively look for disconfirming evidence.English economist John Maynard Keynes asks –

When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?

Don’tfall in love with your ideas so much that it keeps you stuck in a losingcause. The stock doesn’t know that you own it. Sometimes investors take theidea of long term investing to an extreme. They forget that they need toconstantly re-evaluate their positions and change them as situations requireand new data becomes available.

CharlieMunger’s insights on this are invaluable –

The ability to destroy your ideas rapidly instead of slowly when theoccasion is right is one of the most valuable things. You have to work hard onit. Ask yourself what are the arguments on the other side. It’s bad to have anopinion you’re proud of if you can’t state the arguments for the other sidebetter than your opponents. This is a great mental discipline.

One ofgreatest scientists and thinkers, Charles Darwin, was aware of these naturalquirks of human mind. While working on his theory of evolution, he paid specialattention to disconfirming evidence, particularly when it disconfirmedsomething he believed and loved. The moment he found disconfirming evidence orencountered a conflicting thought, he would immediately write it down. He knewthat his brain could conveniently forget about it very soon.

It’snot easy to follow Darwin-like discipline but it won’t hurt if you could makeuse of some tools. [Checklist](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-of-mental-models-checklist/) is one such tool for dealingwith not only cognitive dissonance but many other cognitive errors.

Anotheruseful trick comes from success coach and bestselling author Brian Tracy whosuggests the idea of “zero based thinking”. Before every important decision askyourself this –

“Isthere anything in my life that, knowing what I now know, I would not start upagain today, if I had to do it over?”

If youanswer is yes, then figure out how to get out of your current situation as fastas possible. Prof. Sanjay Bakshi suggests the same thing when it comes to stockmarket investing –

People need a way to de-bias themselves and one good way to do thatis to mentally liquidate the portfolio and turn it into cash and then, for eachsecurity, ask yourself, “Knowing what I know now, would I buy this stock?

Often the honest answer would be a most certain “no”. Then the nextquestion you have to face is – “Then why do I own it now?

When itcomes to cognitive dissonance and for that matter any other behavioural bias,it’s important to know that you don’t have to fight them all the time. You onlyneed to use your tools when the stakes are high.

Now,let’s invert the problem. Instead of dealing with cognitive dissonance, can weavoid it altogether especially in stock market investing? The answer is yes.

Peoplewho look at their portfolios frequently are the ones who get hit by ill-effectsof cognitive dissonance heavily. Every time your portfolio shows losses (whichit invariably will because of volatile stock prices), it creates psychologicalpain for you. Higher the frequency of looking at your portfolio, greater is thepain.

Whenyou know that you have bought the stock for long term, you only need tore-evaluate the fundamental changes in business once a year or may be once aquarter. Minute by minute stock price updates don’t help you, they just drainyou mentally.

Upside Of Cognitive Dissonance

As Iexplained earlier, nature has ingrained every mental bias in human brain for areason and these biases aren’t always bad. So cognitive dissonance is not anoutright evil thing. It too has an upside to it.

Thetwo competing entities in cognitive dissonance are facts and human belief. Wesaw how our brain, to remove cognitive dissonance, changes and aligns thebelief to the action. But it can be other way round also. You could force youraction to align with your beliefs. How?

Haveyou have heard of the phrase ‘fake it till you make it?” This gives a clue howyou can use cognitive dissonance for your advantage. Affirmations or positiveself-talk are psychological tools designed to improve the performance in almostevery known field of human endeavour.

Whenyou have set a goal for yourself, despite your present shortcomings, you forceyour brain to imagine overcoming your limitations. Although the force ofcognitive dissonance makes it difficult to practice, there are countlessprofessional athletes who have used this technique successfully.

However,when you’re being optimistic, don’t ignore the facts. Be aware that there is afine line separating optimism and delusional optimism.

Conclusion

Thebrain we have on the top of our head isn’t a flawless machine. It is definitelypowerful, but it has its weaknesses which in everyday terms, is known as‘biases’. And all cognitive biases, including cognitive dissonance, are mentalhandicaps that come with being human. They can distort our perception ofreality.

So weneed to be aware and equipped to deal with these biases, especially in highstake situations.

Takecare and keep learning.
