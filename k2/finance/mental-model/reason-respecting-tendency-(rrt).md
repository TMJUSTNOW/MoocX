Definition

This isthe human tendency to more readily fulfil requests if a reason is provided,however meaningless or incorrect those reasons may be.

Compliance Rate for Getting your papers Xeroxed 

In 1970sHarvard psychologist Ellen Langer conducted an experiment. She went into alibrary, where there was a long waiting queue in front of the photocopier, andapproached the first person in the queue and asked:

“Excuse me. I have ﬁvepages. May I use the Xerox machine?” Compliance Rate: 64%

ReasonRespecting Tendency- The word “because” is one of the most powerful words inEnglish.

 

In thesecond part of the experiment she gave a reason while making a request.

“Excuse me, I have ﬁvepages. May I use the Xerox machine because I am in a rush?” Compliance Rate: 94%

In 3rdexperiment:

“Excuse me. I have ﬁvepages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies?” Compliance Rate:93%

Implicationfor us:Because people want reasons which explain why something happened, thereare people who materialize to offer reasons even when there isn’t any.

In [Art of Thinking Clearly](http://goo.gl/PkjoOf), Rolf Dobelli writes –

It seems people are addicted to the word ‘because’ – so much so that we use it even when it’snot necessary. If you’re a leader, undoubtedly you have witnessed this. If youprovide no rallying call, employee motivation dwindles. It simply doesn’t makethe grade to say that the purpose of your shoe company is to manufacturefootwear. No: today, higher purposes and the story behind the story isall-important; for example: ‘We want our shoes to revolutionalize themarket’(whatever that means)..

Advantage 

There areadvantages of this tendency. Says Munger, 'It makes a man especially prone tolearn well when a would-be teacher gives correct reasons for what is taught,instead of simply laying out the desired belief ex cathedra with no reasonsgiven. Few practices, therefore, are wiser than not only thinking throughreasons before giving orders but also communicating these reasons to therecipient of the order.'

Disadvantage 

Oftenfound in: When one party wants orders complied with or requests fulfilled morereadily.

Like theother tendencies, the reason-respecting tendency is open to abuse. Says Munger,'Unfortunately, the reason- respecting tendency is so strong that even aperson's giving of meaningless or incorrect reasons will increase compliancewith his orders and requests. This has been demonstrated in psychologyexperiments wherein 'compliance practitioners' successfully jump to the head ofthe lines in front of copying machines by explaining their reason: 'I have tomake some copies'. This sort of unfortunate byproduct of the reason-respectingtendency is a conditioned reflex based on a widespread appreciation of theimportance of reasons. And, naturally, the practice of laying out variousclaptrap reasons is much used by commercial and cult 'compliance practitioners'to help them get what they don't deserve.'

In corporations 

Incorporations: Providing reasons for actions clears confusion and gets moredesirable results. Many corporations have lived by this philosophy. Mungergives the example of Carl Braun.

'One ofmy favorite stories involves a very great businessman named Carl Braun whocreated the CF Braun Engineering Company. It designed and built oil refineries- which is very hard to do. And Braun would get them to come in on time and notblow up and have efficiencies and so forth.

He hadanother rule, from psychology, which, if you're interested in wisdom, ought tobe part of your repertoire - like the elementary mathematics of permutationsand combinations.'

'His rulefor all the Braun Company's communications was called the five W's - you had totell who was going to do what, where, when and why. And if you wrote a letteror directive in the Braun Company telling somebody to do something, and youdidn't tell him why, you could get fired. In fact, you would get fired if youdid it twice.

'Youmight ask why that is so important. Well, again that's a rule of psychology.Just as you think better if you array knowledge on a bunch of models that arebasically answers to the question, why, why, why, if you always tell peoplewhy, they'll understand it better, they'll consider it more important, andthey'll be more likely to comply. Even if they don't understand your reason,they'll be more likely to comply.'

'Sothere's an iron rule that just as you want to start getting worldly wisdom byasking why, why, why, in communicating with other people about everything, youwant to include why, why, why. Even if it's obvious, it's wise to stick in thewhy,' says Munger.

 

 

LewisCarroll (British mathematician and writer, 1832-1898, from Through the LookingGlass)

CharlieMunger has termed this bias as Reason Respecting Tendency (RRT). In hisfamous lecture ‘Psychology of Human Misjudgement’, Charlie explains origin ofthis bias –

There is in man, particularly one in an advanced culture, a naturallove of accurate cognition and a joy in its exercise. This accounts for thewidespread popularity of crossword puzzles, other puzzles, and bridge and chesscolumns, as well as all games requiring mental skill.

This tendency has an obvious implication. It makes man especiallyprone to learn well when a would-be teacher gives correct reasons for what

is taught, instead of simply laying out the desired belief excathedra with no reasons given. Few practices, therefore, are wiser than notonly thinking through reasons before giving orders but also communicating thesereasons to the recipient of the order.

In general, learning is most easily assimilated and used when,lifelong, people consistently hang their experience, actual and vicarious, on alatticework of theory answering the question: Why?

Unfortunately, Reason Respecting Tendency is so strong that even aperson’s giving of meaningless or incorrect reasons will increase compliancewith his orders and requests…This sort of unfortunate byproduct ofReason-Respecting Tendency is a conditioned reflex, based on a widespreadappreciation of the importance of reasons. And, naturally, the practice oflaying out various claptrap reasons is much used by commercial and cult“compliance practitioners” to help them get what they don’t deserve.

Reason for RRT

Thereis a reason for reason respecting tendency. Peter Bevelin, in his book [Seeking Wisdom](http://bit.ly/1vqcGzh), writes –

When people ask us for a favor we are more likely to comply if theygive us a reason even if we don’t understand the reason or it is wrong. Oftenit isn’t the reason itself that is important, but the way the reason isphrased. Sometimes the word “because,” without a sensible reason, is all thatmatters. We want explanations and the word “because” imply an explanation.

CharlieMunger tells the story of Carl Braun, the creator of CF Braun EngineeringCompany –

His rule for all the Braun Company’s communications was called thefive W’s – you had to tell who was going to do what, where, when and why. Andif you wrote a letter or directive in the Braun Company telling somebody to dosomething, and you didn’t tell him why, you could get fired. In fact, you wouldget fired if you did it twice.

You might ask why that is so important? Well, again that’s a rule ofpsychology. Just as you think better if you array knowledge on a bunch ofmodels that are basically answers to the question, why, why, why, if you alwaystell people why, they’ll understand it better, they’ll consider it moreimportant, and they’ll be more likely to comply. Even if they don’t understandyour reason, they’ll be more likely to comply.

So there’s an iron rule that just as you want to start gettingworldly wisdom by asking why, why, why in communicating with other people abouteverything, you want to include why, why, why.

Stock Market Fell Because ..

Wheneverthere is a significant movement in stock prices, you’ll never find the talkingheads on the financial news channels saying, “We don’t know what caused thisrise/fall in the markets.”

Ifthey did, who would listen to them? They know the human need for attaching areason to every wiggle in the stock market. And there is never a dearth of [twaddle](http://www.safalniveshak.com/latticework-mental-models-twaddle-tendency/) when it comes to explaining themarket movements.

Dobelliwrites –

If the stock market rises or falls by half a percent, you will neverhear the true cause from stock market commentators – that it is white noise,the culmination of an infinite number of market movements. No: people want apalpable reason and the commentator is happy to select one. Whateverexplanation he utters will be meaningless – with frequent blame applied to thepronouncements of Federal Reserve bank presidents.

When Istarted investing in stock market, I understood that one needs to do a thoroughanalysis before investing in a stock. So I turned to the paid research reports.These reports had colorful fonts, impressive pie charts and graphs, detailedfinancials and numerous intelligent sounding reasons for buying the recommendedstocks. I was convinced and started buying stocks based on their monthlyrecommendations.

But soona pattern emerged in their stock reports. It seemed that they had a standardtemplate for their stock reports which they filled with their opinions (notreasons) and copied the data from annual reports. Needless to say that I lostmoney in almost all those stock recommendations. I didn’t even get a refund forthe money paid for those research reports.

It tookme few years to realize the importance of independent thinking in investing.Every research report is just an opinion unless you agree with it based on yourown sound reasoning and rational thinking.

The onlyway you can save yourself from RRT is by questioning the reasons provided byothers. And not just others, develop the habit of questioning the reasonsgenerated by your own mind because, as Richard Feynman says, the easiest personto fool is yourself.

Conclusion

ReasonRespecting Tendency is where people want the answers to something but don’tcare to know the background information or reasoning to gain a betterunderstanding.

So nexttime when you find yourself standing at the end of a long queue, you know whatto do to save time. And if somebody tries this trick with you, you can counterit by giving another random excuse.

Or youcan tell him, “Do you think you’re the only one reading Latticework series?” :)

Thepurpose of learning the mental models is to enhance our abilities for makingsense of the world around us. The better we understand the worldly affairs,sharper is our decision making.

Creatingthis latticework of mental models from multiple disciplines is about theability of seeing patterns – how ideas and things relate and hang together.Knowledge that can be used in a variety of situations.

Aristotlesaid: “For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doingthem.” This means we need to practice what we have learnt in varioussituations.

So startimplementing what you learn and the first step to implementing any kind ofknowledge is to teach it someone else. So don’t just share the link withothers, make efforts to explain the idea in your words, in your own unique way.

Take careand keep learning.
