“I hated discussing ideas with investors, because Ithen became a defender of the idea and that influences your thought process.”~ Michael Burry (The Big Short)

I’m surethis is one statement most of you will relate to. We often discuss stock ideaswhich, we understand, are contingent to future events but if we declare/discussthe ideas in public, irrespective of how the events unfold, it becomesextremely difficult (subconsciously) for us to change the stance we have takenin public.

MohnishPabrai of Pabrai Funds has often repeated during his annual investor meetingsthat he doesn’t discuss current stock investments as it clouds judgment.

Ipractice the same rule (but for a different reason – that of avoiding extreme embarrassment in future). :)

AsRobert Cialdini explains in [The Psychology of Persuasion](http://bit.ly/1cnq5Re), there isan obsessive desire to be consistent with what we have done or said in thepast. He writes…

Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounterpersonal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with thatcommitment. Those pressures will cause us to respond in ways that justify ourearlier decision.

Henamed this psychological tendency as ‘Commitment and Consistency’.

Oncewe’ve made a commitment – apromise, a choice, taken a stand, invested time, money or effort – we want toremain consistent. We want to feel that we’ve made the right decision. And themore we have invested in our behavior the harder it is to change.

LikeBollywood actor Salman Khan says in the first 10 seconds of [Salman KhanWanted Ek baar Jo Maine Commitment Kar Di To](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JbeXhbx_ko)… :)

 

 

Theeconomist Adam Smith said in [The Theory of the Moral Sentiments](http://bit.ly/15pPMI2)… 

The opinion which we entertain of our own character depends entirelyon our judgments concerning our past conduct. It is so disagreeable to thinkill of ourselves, that we often purposely turn away our view from thosecircumstances which might render that judgment unfavorable.

We wantto maintain a positive self-image. When that is violated, we use differentdefenses in order to justify our behavior. We also behave in ways that areconsistent with how others see us. If people label us as talented, we try toappear talented whether or not it is true.

 

Mungerin his speech The Psychologyof Misjudgment uses the inverted version to representthe bias it causes and calls it ‘Inconsistency-avoidance bias’.

Heexplains that the human brain conserves programming space by being reluctant tochange.

Most ofus who have made New Year resolutions to change an old habit need no convincingon the above statement as we have all experienced how difficult it is to changeold habits.

There isa psychological force which resists the change and forces us to actconsistently with past behavior that makes habits self enforcing.

 

Warren Buffett puts it very well – “Chains of habitare too light to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.”See [chains of habit story](http://k2invest.blogspot.in/2015/01/chains-of-habit.html). 

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/62318AA6-BCB6-5042-B16C-4DDC249423E4.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EMZQHmKGpVA/Vn9_2JITN-I/AAAAAAAA5a8/NTcR6vFPFdQ/s1600/chains_of_habit-lecture-04_page_11.jpg)

 

At thesubconscious level, commitment and consistency leads us to what we already knowas “confirmation bias”, where we seek for new information in confirmation toolder beliefs/decisions.

We haveoften seen it in various disciplines, especially science, that for years andyears the work scientists do is incremental but the defining moments are notonly often radical but are also the ones that are always rejected first. Thisis because they are inconsistent with the previous findings.

Theeffect of this bias is enhanced with the amount of effort one puts in reachingthe older conclusions. More the effort, harder it is to change and higher isthe probability to remain consistent with previous decisions.

Variouscults, religions and clubs have used this tendency of humans to induce greatersense of devotion by increasing the effort required to be part of the group.

Lying through your nose

Once youtell a public lie, you will have to keep on inventing more and more lies to beconsistent with the ﬁrst one.

If youtake a public stand, and later ﬁnd, you were wrong, you will ﬁnd it hard toreverse your stand. After all, you don't want to look foolish and ﬁckle minded…

Buthaving a ﬂexible mind, which is subject to change based on new informationwhich changes the odds is a PRECONDITION for success in science, in investmentmanagement, in all professions that that matter…

Learning from Richard Feynman

Inhis remarkable book [ThePleasures of Finding Things Out](http://bit.ly/15pQe9q), Richard Feynmanwrites…

You see, one thing is, I can live with doubt and uncertainty and notknowing. I think it’s much more interesting to live not knowing than to haveanswers which might be wrong.

I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and differentdegrees of certainty about different things, but I’m not absolutely sure ofanything and there are many things that I don’t know anything about, such aswhether it means anything to ask why we’re here, and what the question mightmean.

 

It isbetter to have a doubtful frame of mind than to have incorrect answers and thenremain committed to them. Why? In today’s world, people do not need any reasonto believe. They are gullible. But in this state you will make a lot ofincorrect decisions.

Themoment you have a doubtful state of mind, you will be curious to find outanswers and get over your commitment bias. This will increase the odds of youmaking correct decisions.

 

Commitment & Consistency in Investing

Forinvestors and corporate managers, there are numerous occasions where they canobserve the commitment and consistency bias coming into action.

Businessmanagers often find themselves in a situation where they keep on investing intoa project till completion even if halfway down it’s obvious that it isinefficient use of capital.

InCorporate Finance, it’s called the “sunk cost fallacy”.

In thewise businessman’s lingo, it’s called ‘throwing good money after bad’.

Incorporate mergers and acquisitions, the same bias forces managements to keep onallocating more capital into a recent merger in an attempt to revive it.

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/55AAC49B-8FF7-6141-8380-1EE0F3F61876.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a9_-EGLTdYs/Vn5m3kJxjqI/AAAAAAAA5Tw/h4ZDoldhwf0/s1600/commitment-bias-tata-steel_corus.jpg)

Forexample, take a look at Tata Steel’s expensive acquisition of the Europeansteelmaker Corus.

InOctober 2006, Tata Steel proposed to buy Corus by paying 455 pence per share tothe latter’s shareholders. While Corus’s management approved the acquisition,in November 2006, the Brazilian steel company CSN launched a counter offer forCorus at 475 pence per share. Tata then offered 500 pence, then CSN raised itto 515 and then to 603 pence per share.

InJanuary 2007, Tata Steel finally announced that it was buying Corus at 608pence per share, or 33% higher than its original bid of 455 pence!

As itstands now, after writing off $1.6 billion from its balance sheet towards lossat Corus, Tata Steel is now looking to sell off some of the former’s assets inorder to deleverage its balance sheet, apart from cutting jobs and closingmanufacturing sites.

Thecompany is in a fire-fighting mode and is trying to do everything under the sunto remain consistent with its original decision of buying Corus.

Not justTata Steel and Corus, most acquisitions fail over the long run due to thecommitment and consistency bias of the buyers. First, buyers pay expensiveprice for acquisitions and then when the expected benefits are not seen, theythrow more good money after bad to remain consistent to their original actionsinstead of looking like fools.

Not justcompanies making acquisitions, even individual investors often face this biasin two ways:

One, itis very difficult and time consuming to change the stance on a particular stockin the light of new information.

Two, itcreates mental difficulties in capital allocation in a portfolio, especially ifthe new stock is going to replace an old stock. Selling decisions oftenexperience the commitment and consistency bias acting upon them. If one runs aconcentrated portfolio which involves acquiring a substantial position in acompany after a lot of effort, one can often find it difficult to change theopinion on the stock even if it’s warranted.

There areseveral examples of commitment and consistency bias I can share from mypersonal experience as an investor, but here are two worth noting.

 

Case #1: Hotel Leela

I was inBangalore sometime in early 2006 and visited Leela Palace to meet a friend whowas attending a conference there. I was in awe of the property – it was grand,and amazingly beautiful.

Onenquiring, I got to know that the hotel was one of the most expensive locationsin India and was still completely booked for the next few months.

Thestory was same everywhere –most of Leela’s properties werebooked for months, despite their premium pricing.

“What anamazing business!” I told myself. “Just imagine the kind of profits these guysmust be making. I must have this stock in my portfolio!”

The nextday, without enquiring more about Leela’s business and financial performance, Ibought the stock, expecting it to be a story that was waiting to be unveiled.

Well, itwas indeed a story waiting to be unveiled…and for me. When I glanced throughthe company’s annual report ‘after’ buying its stock, I saw a business that hadbeen high on debt in the past – indicating a management that was willing to putits company on high risk to grow its business.

By thetime I had made up my mind to sell the stock, it fell 10% from the purchaseprice.

“Let meaverage down my costs!” I said to myself. “What if the company repairs itsbalance sheet and things look better for it? I will have a great stock in myhand then.”

Thus Iput some money in the stock. It fell another 5%, and I bought more. By thistime, my losses were big enough (in percentage terms) for me to have sold thestock. So I put more money onto it.

In aroundearly 2008, when I finally decided to part away with the stock after the lossesbecame unbearable, the holding was down 45% from the purchase price.

 

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/84ABDB1F-B3CD-3447-980C-D0042B8BA727.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IDVxsUkFQkg/Vn5m-OPocZI/AAAAAAAA5T4/Ty10XzjEw5E/s1600/schart-commitment-bias-HotelLeela.png)

SoI sold it, but only after bearing the brunt of being consistent to my originaldecision and then barrelling up more good money on bad money. Case #2: Praj Industries

“Greenenergy” was one theme that had caught my attention during the 2006-07 period,after having seen several stocks from industries involved in green energyraking up great returns for investors in the previous years.

One ofthe stocks that caught my fancy was Praj Industries, the manufacturer ofmachines that made ethanol (fuel created from corn and sugarcane). Ethanol wasbecoming a hot topic in the western world, where a large part of Praj’s demandwas coming from. And the benefits accrued for Praj’s investors in India.

So I alsobought the stock expecting to make great returns from the bright future ofgreen energy in general and ethanol in particular.

Now, evenas I was buying Praj, I tried to overlook some of the negatives surrounding theethanol industry. One was that it was consuming a lot of corn and sugarcanethat would have otherwise been consumed by people, and was thus leading torising food prices.

Two,green energy has always been a market dependent on government regulations, andin times of an economic collapse, the government’s focus on these areas comesdown, leading to a collapse in demand for green energy companies.

But Iclosed my ears on these negatives, and bought some units of Praj at every dropin its price. My investment in the stock was not that big to have wiped away mysavings, but I was consistently adding on to my position – till it becamealmost 5% of my total portfolio.

 

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/94EF0B46-5C5E-5C4C-A2CA-16FCE3DB6FFF.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3UUlQfOrC6Y/Vn5nCUf1wvI/AAAAAAAA5UA/i_skxZbiqyA/s1600/schart-commitment-bias-PrajIndustries.png)

I hadfallen into the commitment and consistency bias, as my original investment intothe stock – and the hard work that had gone into researching the stock – led meto pour more money so that I could average down my cost. Like in case of HotelLeela, I sold off Praj only when the pain became unbearable, and my holdingswere down almost 50%.

I have afew other similar examples when commitment and consistency bias caused me somegrief (and I also got lucky in some cases), but that’s not important here. 

What isimportant is that this is one easy bias to fall into simply because most of usdon’t like to go back on our commitments as that would degrade us in our owneyes.

But then,it’s important to never forget the rule that the first rule of investing is tonot lose money. Thus, it’s important to avoid falling into the bias.

How? Iwill discuss that in just a minute.

How Companies Guide

Anotherfrequent area where we observe this tendency in play is the constant effortfrom companies to meet their ‘guidance’.

Companiestry various operational and accounting tricks to ‘meet the numbers’. Onoccasions, things go bad. Here is a very astute observation by Buffett in his2000 letter to shareholders…

The problem arising from lofty predictions is not just that theyspread unwarranted optimism. Even more troublesome is the fact that theycorrode CEO behavior. Over the years, Charlie and I have observed manyinstances in which CEOs engaged in uneconomic operating maneuvers so that theycould meet earnings targets they had announced. Worse still, after exhaustingall that operating acrobatics would do, they sometimes played a wide variety ofaccounting games to “make the numbers.

These accounting shenanigans have a way of snowballing.

Once a company moves earnings from one period to another, operatingshortfalls that occur thereafter require it to engage in further accountingmaneuvers that must be even more “heroic.” These can turn fudging into fraud.

Remindsyou of anything recent in the history of Indian equities?

WheneverI read this passage, I instantly recall a very catchy but apt phrase used bythe CEO of a very prominent Indian organization – “It was like riding a tiger,not knowing how to get off without being eaten.”

RamalingaRaju surely learnt his lesson on psychological biases in a very hard way. Thisis what he wrote in his 2009 letter to the board of directors on the eventfulday the Satyam scam broke out…

The gap in the Balance Sheet has arisen purely on account ofinflated profits over a period of last several years…

…what started as a marginal gap between actual operating profit andthe one reflected in the books of accounts continued to grow over the years. Ithas attained unmanageable proportions as the size of company operations grewsignificantly…

…every attempt was made to eliminate the gap failed. As thepromoters held a small percentage of equity, the concern was that poorperformance would result in a take-over; thereby exposing the gap. It was likeriding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten…

(Importantnote: Whenever an example like the above is used to demonstrate a particularpsychological bias, it is important to understand that the bias is only part ofthe explanation for the event. Almost all prominent events like the onedescribed above are results of lot of psychological biases coming together).

 

The Art of Inconsistency

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/89C0ACC5-93FD-1547-9D85-84CD3BA80F34.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Mv22vuTYlg8/Vn5nHe4hIPI/AAAAAAAA5UI/yppICfnO3w4/s1600/commitment-bias-purple_duck.png)

Here is asmall story I would like to share on how sometimes being inconsistent is soimportant for us.

“Colourthe duck yellow, and her umbrella green,” instructed the kindergarten teacherto her students.

But whensix-year old Kavya handed her drawing sheet, the teacher asked, “Dear, didn’tyou understand my instructions? You have coloured the duck purple and herumbrella red! Have you ever seen a purple duck?”

Kavyadidn’t miss a beat, and replied, “But ma’am, I’ve also never seen a duckcarrying an umbrella!”

Now, isKavya a young rebel?

Given theanswer she gave her teacher, Kavya might not be a model student. But shedefinitely is a brilliant thinker.

Yousee, following some rules is absolutely necessary for us – like while driving, crossing the street,or paying our taxes. But, as Kavya shows through her answer, always beingconsistent will not provide a creative solution to all our problems.

We needto train our brains to look around at all possibilities and to unleash thepower of creative thinking that lies dormant within most of us. But for that tohappen, we must first slow down instead of living life in the fast lane, andtake out time for solitude.

As thenoted American psychologist Rollo May said, “In order to be open to creativity,one must have the capacity for constructive use of solitude. One must overcomethe fear of being alone.”

Unfortunately,the pressures and stresses of today’s fast-paced world squeeze out our creativethinking time and replace it with lists of things to do and action items thatare of much less importance.

We allwant to major in minor things, and this is what keeps us busy through the bestyears of our lives. But it’s important to realize that your mind is theultimate creativity machine.

Like achild, if you can fuel it with the right stimuli and leave it alone for sometime to function as it has been designed, the output can be stunning.

It may beinconsistent with what is popular, but that is fine.

 

Be Inconsistent, My Friend!

Pleasedon’t get me wrong, for I don’t want to demean consistency. I think beingconsistent is important for a lot of reasons.

Butthen, as Einstein said, “Insanity:doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”

That, Ibelieve, is the biggest pitfall of consistency. Being consistent and expectinginconsistent results!

If youwant to get better than the average results in life, be inconsistent, for thatis the hallmark of the imaginative. Be willing to stick your neck out.

Take astand, and take it against yourself if you have to. And why not? No one thatmatters will blame you for it.

Colourthe duck purple, my friend, even if no one has ever seen it.

Dealing with Commitment and Consistency Bias

Keep in Mind

How canyou avoid the traps and exploit this bias for your benefit? Here are a fewways…

- Don’t be a     defender of ideas:     In an investing career, it is imperative to be able to change views and     inculcate new information objectively. Don’t publicly commit to ideas if     you feel the pressure or embarrassment to change your views later on. In     the investment process, especially for the portfolio allocation problem     discussed above, a very powerful antidote that has been practiced by many     successful investors is that of mental liquidation of the portfolio to     cash and then thinking what is the best use of the cash at the given time.     
- Do not make     absolute statements in public: Scientists know this very well. Even before they reach     the conclusions, they always hedge it by saying that the decision is on     currently available information and can also change. This is also a true     reflection of humility in science as compared to other pseudo sciences     that tried to sell certainty. Salesmen have used this tendency of     commitment and consistency by asking potential customers for smaller     commitments. Once the customer agrees to the smaller commitments, the     salesmen will then ask for larger commitments. You may have observed it     especially in various charities selling where they request you to ‘just     sign’ the petition. And when you have shown a commitment to the cause by     signing the petition, they will often ask for a small donation for a cause     ‘YOU’ feel so ‘committed’ to. Beware when making small commitments! 
- Practice     being a destroyer of your ideas: This is very important, and also the toughest of all.     Practice being a destroyer of your ideas and admit inconsistency when     there is one. Not many people can do this but we can always learn from     Keynes who when criticized for changing his position on monetary policy     during the Great Depression, replied – “When my information changes, I     alter my conclusions. What do you do, sir?” 
- Avoid the     sunk cost fallacy:     Learn to walk away from bad investment decisions you made in the past. We     all make financial mistakes. But when you realize you’ve done something     wrong, try not to think about the money (and time and emotion) you’ve     already spent. Instead, decide what to do based on the present and the     future. 

In [Why Smart People Make Big MoneyMistakes](http://bit.ly/16Dq99G), the authors write…

Once your money is spent, it’s gone. It has no relevance. To theextent you can incorporate that notion into your financial decisions, you’ll bethat much better off for trying. If you’re debating the sale of an investment(or a home), for example, remember that your goal is to maximize your wealthand your enjoyment. The goal is not to justify your decision to buy theinvestment at whatever price you originally paid for it. Who cares?

What counts, in terms of getting where you want to be tomorrow, iswhat that investment is worth today.

Finally,remember what Buffett said – “The most important thing to do when youfind yourself in a hole is to stop digging.”
