Self-deception is aprocess of [denying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial) or [rationalizing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_%28psychology%29) away the relevance,significance, or importance of opposing [evidence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence) and [logical argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_argument). Self-deceptioninvolves convincing oneself of a truth (or lack of truth) so that one does notreveal any self-knowledge of the deception.[[citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]

Definitional problems

Aconsensus on the identification of self-deception remains elusive tocontemporary philosophers, the result of the term's paradoxical elements andambiguous paradigmatic cases. Self-deception also incorporates numerousdimensions, such as [epistemology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology), [psychological](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological) and [intellectual](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual) processes, [socialcontexts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_context), and [morality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality). As a result, the term is highly debated and occasionally argued tobe an impossible phenomenon.

Theorization

Analysis

Thetraditional paradigm of self-deception focuses on interpersonal deception, asdescribed by the StanfordEncyclopedia of Philosophy. In this paradigm, A intentionallygets B to believe some proposition p, all the while knowing or believing truly~p.Such deception is intentional and requires the deceiver to know or believe ~p and the deceivedto believe p. On this traditional mode, self-deceivers must (1) holdcontradictory beliefs and (2) intentionally get themselves to hold a beliefthey know or believe truly to be false.[[1\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deception#cite_note-stanford-1)

Theprocess of rationalization, however, can obscure the intent of self-deception.Brian McLaughlin illustrates that such rationalizations in certaincircumstances permit the phenomenon. When a person, who disbelieves p, intentionallytries to make himself believe or continue believing p by engaging insuch activities, and, as a result unintentionally misleads himself intobelieving or continuing to believe p via biased thinking, he deceives himselfin a way appropriate for self-deception. No deceitful intention is required forthis.[[2\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deception#cite_note-2)

Psychology

Self-deceptioncalls into question the nature of the individual, specifically in apsychological context and the nature of "self". Irrationality is thefoundation upon which the argued paradoxes of self-deception stem, and it isargued[[weasel word\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WEASEL) that not everyone has the "special talents" andcapacities for self-deception.[[3\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deception#cite_note-3)However, rationalization is influenced by a myriad of factors, includingsocialization, personal biases, fear, and cognitive repression. Suchrationalization can be manipulated in both positive and negative fashions;convincing one to perceive a negative situation optimistically and vice versa.In contrast, rationalization alone cannot effectively clarify the dynamics ofself-deception, as reason is just one adaptive form mental processes can take.[[4\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deception#cite_note-4) It canmoreover be argued[[weasel word\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WEASEL) that current psychology's attempts to study processes, mechanism,and functions of self-deception often suffer from inadequate explications ofthe very concept of self-deception, and that the concept of rationality at workin such studies is not unproblematic either. In effect, such studies perhaps donot even succeed in showing that the phenomenon exists at all.[[5\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deception#cite_note-5)

Paradoxes of self-deception

Theworks of philosopher [Alfred R. Mele](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Mele) have provided insightinto some of the more prominent paradoxes regarding self-deception. Two ofthese paradoxes include the self-deceiver's state of mind and the dynamics ofself-deception, coined the "static" paradox and the "dynamic/strategic"paradox, respectively.

Meleformulates an example of the "static" paradox as the following:

If ever a person A deceives a person B into believing that something, p, is true, A knows or trulybelieves that p is false while causing B to believe that p is true. So whenAdeceives A (i.e., himself) into believing that p is true, he knows or trulybelieves that p is false while causing himself to believe that p is true. Thus, A mustsimultaneously believe that p is false and believe that p is true. But how is this possible?[[6\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deception#cite_note-Mele-6)

Mele thendescribes the "dynamic/strategy" paradox:

In general, A cannot successfully employ a deceptive strategy against B if B knows A's intention andplan. This seems plausible as well when A and B are the same person. A potentialself-deceiver's knowledge of his intention and strategy would seem typically torender them ineffective. On the other hand, the suggestion that self-deceiverstypically successfully execute their self-deceptive strategies without knowingwhat they are up to may seem absurd; for an agent's effective execution of hisplans seems generally to depend on his cognizance of them and their goals. Sohow, in general, can an agent deceive himself by employing a self-deceptive strategy?[[6\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deception#cite_note-Mele-6)

Thesemodels call into question how one can simultaneously hold contradictory beliefs("static" paradox) and deceive oneself without rendering one'sintentions ineffective ("dynamic/strategic" paradox). Attempts at aresolution to these have created two schools of thought: one that maintainsthat paradigmatic cases of self-deception are intentional and one that deniesthe notionâ€”intentionalists and non-intentionalists, respectively.[[1\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deception#cite_note-stanford-1)

Intentionaliststend to agree that self-deception is intentional, but divide over whether itrequires the holding of contradictory beliefs.[[1\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deception#cite_note-stanford-1) Thisschool of thought incorporates elements of temporal partitioning (extended overtime to benefit the self-deceiver, increasing the chance of forgetting thedeception altogether) and psychological partitioning (incorporating variousaspects of the "self").

Non-intentionalists,in contrast, tend to believe that cases of self-deception are not necessarilyaccidental, but motivated by desire, anxiety, or some other emotion regarding p or related to p.[[1\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deception#cite_note-stanford-1) Thisnotion distinguishes self-deception from misunderstanding. Furthermore,"wishful thinking" is distinguished from self-deception in that theself-deceivers recognize evidence against their self-deceptive belief orpossess, without recognizing, greater counterevidence than wishful thinkers.[[1\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deception#cite_note-stanford-1)

Numerousquestions and debates remain in play with respect to the paradoxes ofself-deception, and a consensual paradigm has yet to appear.

Trivers' theory of self-deception

Ithas been theorized that humans are susceptible to self-deception because mostpeople have emotional attachments to beliefs, which in some cases may be [irrational](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational). Some [evolutionary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology) biologists, such as [RobertTrivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Trivers), have suggested[[7\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deception#cite_note-7) that [deception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception) plays a significant part in human behavior, and in animal behavior,more generally speaking. One deceives oneself to trust something that is nottrue as to better convince others of that truth. When a person convincesthemself of this untrue thing, they better mask the signs of deception.

Thisnotion is based on the following [logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic): deception is a fundamental aspect of communication in nature, bothbetween and within species. It has evolved so that one can have an advantageover another. From alarm calls to mimicry, animals use deception to furthertheir survival. Those who are better able to perceive deception are more likelyto survive. As a result, self-deception evolved to better mask deception fromthose who perceive it well, as Trivers puts it: "Hiding the truth fromyourself to hide it more deeply from others." In humans, [awareness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness) of the fact that one is acting deceptively often leads to tell-talesigns of deception, such as nostrils flaring, clammy skin, quality and tone ofvoice, eye movement, or excessive blinking. Therefore, if self-deceptionenables someone to believe her or his own distortions, they will not presentsuch signs of deception and will therefore appear to be telling the truth.

Self-deceptioncan be used both to act greater or lesser than one actually is. For example,one can act overconfident to attract a mate or act under-confident to avoid apredator or threat. If a person is capable of concealing their true feelingsand intentions well, then they are more likely to successfully deceive others.

Itmay also be argued that the ability to deceive, or self-deceive, is not theselected trait but a by-product of a more primary trait called [abstractthinking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_thinking). Abstract thinking allows manyevolutionary advantages such as more flexible, adaptive behaviors andinnovation. Since a lie is an [abstraction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction), the mental process of creating a lie can only occur in animalswith enough brain complexity to permit abstract thinking.[[citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]Self-deception lowers cognitive cost; that is to say, it is less complicatedfor one to behave or think in a certain manner that implies something is true,if one has convinced oneself that that very thing is indeed true. The mind willnot have to think constantly of the true thing and then the false thing, butsimply convince itself that the false thing is true.

Evolutionary implications of Trivers' theory ofself-deception

Becausethere is deceit, there exists a strong selection to recognize when deceptionoccurs. As a result, self-deception evolves so as to better hide the signs ofdeception from others. The presence of deception explains the existence of aninnate ability to commit self-deception to hide the indications of deceptions.Humans deceive themselves in order to better deceive others and thus have anadvantage over them. In the three decades since Trivers introduced his adaptivetheory of self-deception, there has been an ongoing debate over the question ofsuch behavior having a genetic basis.

Theexplanation of deception and self-deception as innate characteristics isperhaps true, but there are very many other explanations for this pattern ofbehavior. It is possible that the ability to self-deceive is not innate, but alearned trait, acquired through experience. For example, a person could havebeen caught being deceitful by revealing their knowledge of information theywere trying to hide. Their nostrils flared, indicating that they were lying tothe other person, and thus did not get what they wanted. Next time, to betterachieve success, the person will more actively deceive themself of havingknowledge to better hide the signs of deception. People, therefore, could havethe capacity to learn self-deception.

Examples

Thoughthe term is difficult to define, examples of self-deception are abundant invarying degrees. Simple instances of self-deception include common occurrencessuch as: the alcoholic who is self-deceived in believing that his drinking isunder control, the husband who is self-deceived in believing that his wife isnot having an affair, the jealous colleague who is self-deceived in believingthat her colleague's greater professional success is due to ruthless ambition.
