The oldadage 'practice makes perfect' was drilled into our heads by ourschoolteachers, especially for maths and accounts, and, of course, our parents,who told us this numerous times. 

The use-it-or-lose-it tendency is the tendency to lose the skillsthat you have if you don't use them regularly. 'All skills attenuate withdisuse. I was a whiz at calculus until age twenty, after which the skill wassoon obliterated by total nonuse,' says Munger.

Suchcontinuous practice of skills is not limited to ordinary human beings. Even toppractitioners of their fields rely on continuous practice to keep themselvessharp. Munger cites the example of renowned Polish pianist Ignacy JanPaderewski, 'The pianist Paderewski once said that if he failed to practice fora single day, he could notice his performance deterioration and that, after aweek's gap in practice, the audience could notice it as well.' The solution?'Skills of a very high order can be maintained only with daily practice.'

 

Use it OR Loose it In Life

How doesthis tendency work in real life? Says Munger, 'Throughout his life, a wise manengages in practice of all his useful, rarely used skills, many of them outsidehis discipline, as a sort of duty to his better self. If he reduces the numberof skills he practices and, therefore, the number of skills he retains, he willnaturally drift into error from man with a hammer tendency. His learningcapacity will also shrink as he creates gaps in the latticework of theory heneeds as a framework for understanding new experience. It is also essential fora thinking man to assemble his skills into a checklist that he routinely uses.Any other mode of operation will cause him to miss much that is important.'

Oftenfound in: Honing skills, continuous learning and practice add to the wealth ofskills you already have.

In Life:Remember the time our teachers used to hammer into our heads the idea that weshould understand what we learn and not merely cram it all up for a test? Turnsout they were right all along. 'The hard rule of the use-it-or-lose-it tendencytempers its harshness for the diligent. If a skill is raised to fluency,instead of merely being crammed in briefly to enable one to pass some test,then the skill (1) will be lost more slowly and (2) will come back faster whenrefreshed with new learning. These are not minor advantages, and a wise manengaged in learning some important skill will not stop until he is reallyfluent in it.'

Let us get the basics right

Nervoussystem is divided into two parts; central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Brain and spinal cord forms the central nervous system. It is ourcommand-and-control center. The peripheral nervous system, which bringsmessages from the sense receptors to the spinal cord and brain and carriesmessages from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles and glands.

Brainand spinal cord is made up of many cells and one of them is a nerve cell orneuron. Neurons are cells that send and receive electro-chemical signals to andfrom the brain. There are about 100 billion neurons in our brain. Each neuronhas three parts; dendrites, cell, and axons.

The dendrites are treelike branches that receiveinput from other neurons. These dendrites lead into the cell body, whichsustains the life of the cell and contains its DNA. Finally the axon is aliving cable of varying lengths (from microscopic lengths in the brain, to somethat can run down to the legs and reach up to six feet long). Axons are oftencompared to wires because they carry electrical impulses at very high speeds(from 2 to 200 miles per hour ) toward the dendrites of neighboring neurons.

A neuron can receive two kinds of signals:those that excite it and those that inhibit it. If a neuron receives enoughexcitatory signals from other neurons, it will fire off its own signal. When itreceives enough inhibitory signals, it becomes less likely to fire. Axons don’tquite touch the neighboring dendrites. They are separated by a microscopicspace called a synapse. Once an electrical signal gets to the end of the axon,it triggers the release of a chemical messenger, called a neurotransmitter,into the synapse. The chemical messenger floats over to the dendrite of theadjacent neuron, exciting or inhibiting it. When we say that neurons “rewire”themselves, we mean that alterations occur at the synapse, strengthening andincreasing, or weakening and decreasing, the number of connections between theneurons.

Brain Maps

Ourbrain has specific processing areas called as brain maps. When we use our right handthe information gets processed in one location and when we smile theinformation gets processed in another location in the brain. By having specificprocessing areas, our brain can handle things efficiently. This is similar tohow Adam Smith’s [pin factory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process) worked. Also the brain mapis organized topographically; the map is ordered as the body itself is ordered.Our middle finger sits between our index finger and ring finger. The map forthe middle finger sits between the map for our index finger and ring finger.Topographical organization is efficient, because it means that parts of thebrain that often work together are close together in the brain map, so signalsdon’t have to travel far in the brain itself. By the process of evolution bynatural selection our brain has worked out an efficient design. But a curiousmind should ask how does this topographic order emerge in the brain map?

A topographic order emerges because manyof our everyday activities involve repeating sequences in a fixed order. Whenwe pick up an object the size of an apple or baseball, we usually grip it firstwith our thumb and index finger, then wrap the rest of our fingers around itone by one. Since the thumb and index finger often touch at almost the sametime, sending their signals to the brain almost simultaneously, the thumb mapand the index finger map tend to form close together in the brain. (Neurons that firetogether wire together.) Aswe continue to wrap our hand around the object, our middle finger will touch itnext, so its brain map will tend to be beside the index finger and farther awayfrom the thumb. As this common grasping sequence—thumb first, index fingersecond, middle finger third— is repeated thousands of times, it leads to abrain map where the thumb map is next to the index finger map, which is next tothe middle finger map, and so on. Signals that tend to arrive at separatetimes, like thumbs and pinkies, have more distant brain maps, because neurons that fire apartwire apart.

Sincethe brain maps had one location for one function, the medical communityincorrectly generalized that if a part was damaged, the brain couldnot reorganize itself or recover that lost function. There were severalevidences to disprove the claim but majority of the doctors ignored them.In fact they rejected papers that had the word plasticity in it. They wereoperating under [psychological denial](http://fundooprofessor.wordpress.com/2005/09/05/jared-diamonds-dam-fools/). Those who know about efficient market theory in finance should notbe surprised by this behavior. It took several decades of work frompeople like Michael Merzenich, VS Ramachandran, and Edward Taub toprove that the brain is plastic and it can be rewired at any age.[Video - VS Ramachandran: 3Clues to Understand your brain](https://youtu.be/Rl2LwnaUA-k)

Use it or lose it

Amonkey’s hand like a human’s has three main nerves – radial, median, and ulnar. The median nerve conveys sensation from the middle of the hand.The other two conveys information from either side of the hand. In oneexperiment, Merzenich with the help of his friend Jon Kaas cut the median nervein monkey’s hand. Two months later  he remapped the monkey’s brain and found out that brain map thatserves the median nerve showed no activity when he touched the middle part ofthe hand. But he was shocked by something else.

When he stroked the outsides of the monkey’s hand—the areas that send their signals through the radial and ulnar nerves—themedian nerve map lit up! The brain maps for the radial and ulnar nerves hadalmost doubled in size and invaded what used to be the median nerve map. Andthese new maps were topographical. This time he and Kaas, writing up thefindings, called the changes “spectacular” and used the word “plasticity” toexplain the change, though they put it in quotes.

The experiment demonstrated that if themedian nerve was cut, other nerves, still brimming with electrical input, wouldtake over the unused map space to process their input. When it came toallocating brain-processing power, brainmaps were governed by competition for precious resources and the principle ofuse it or lose it.

The competitive nature of plasticityaffects us all. There is an endless war of nerves going on inside each of ourbrains. Ifwe stop exercising our mental skills, we do not just forget them: the brain mapspace for those skills is turned over to the skills we practice instead. If you ever ask yourself, “How oftenmust I practice French, or guitar, or math to keep on top of it?” you areasking a question about competitive plasticity. You are asking how frequentlyyou must practice one activity to make sure its brain map space is not lost toanother.

Ifwe do not use a skill we will lose it. Charlie Munger in one of his [talks](http://theidealstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mungermisjudgment.pdf) spoke about this.

Cultivate good habits early

Dictionarymeaning of habit is a settledor regular tendency or practice, especially one that is hard to give up. Habits profoundly change our neural structures and take upspace in the brain map. This is true for both good and bad habits. Once ahabit occupies the brain map it is very hard to get rid of it. Imagine if it isoccupied by a bad habit like drug addiction. Life will be a misery. It is veryimportant to form good habits at a young age.

Competitive plasticity also explains whyour bad habits are so difficult to break or “unlearn.” Most of us think of thebrain as a container and learning as putting something in it . When we try tobreak a bad habit, we think the solution is to put something new into thecontainer. Butwhen we learn a bad habit, it takes over a brain map, and each time we repeatit, it claims more control of that map and prevents the use of that space for“good” habits . That is why“unlearning” is often a lot harder than learning, and why early childhoodeducation is so important—it’s best to get it right early, before the “badhabit” gets a competitive advantage.

Imagination

[AnatolySharansky](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25560162), the Soviet human rights activist, usedmental chess to survive in prison. In 1977 he was falsely accused of spying forthe United States. He spent nine years in a Siberian prison and of which hespent 400 days in solitary confinement. The punishment cell was dark, measuringonly five-by-six foot, and it was freezing cold. Under these extremeconditions, human brain loses its brain maps and needs some externalstimulation keep it alive. What did Sharansky do?

During this extended period of sensorydeprivation, Sharansky played mental chess for months on end, which probablyhelped him keep his brain from degrading. He played both white and black, holding the gamein his head , from opposite perspectives— an extraordinary challenge to thebrain . Sharansky once toldme, half joking, that he kept at chess thinking he might as well use theopportunity to become the world champion. After he was released, with the helpof Western pressure, he went to Israel and became a cabinet minister. When the worldchampion Garry Kasparov played against the prime minister and leaders of thecabinet, he beat all of them except Sharansky.

It isvery important to keep our thoughts clean. Bad thoughts like envy, jealousy,anger, and self-pity will cause structural changes to our brain maps in anegative way. Why waste our brain maps on such negative thoughts whenthere is zero upside and infinite downside?  In one experiment, Drs. GuangYue and Kelly Cole showed that imagining one is using one’s muscles actuallystrengthens them.

The study looked at two groups, one that did physicalexercise and one that imagined doing exercise. Both groups exercised a fingermuscle, Monday through Friday, for four weeks. The physical group did trials offifteen maximal contractions, with a twenty-second rest between each. Themental group merely imagined doing fifteen maximal contractions, with atwenty-second rest between each, while also imagining a voice shouting at them,“Harder! Harder! Harder!”

At the end of the study the subjects whohad done physical exercise increased their muscular strength by 30 percent, asone might expect. Those who only imagined doing the exercise, for the same period,increased their muscle strength by 22 percent. The explanation lies in the motor neurons of the brain that“program” movements. During these imaginary contractions, the neuronsresponsible for stringing together sequences of instructions for movements areactivated and strengthened, resulting in increased strength when the musclesare contracted.

Learnings helps your brain grow

Valuelearning over money. Learning increases the number of branches in our neuronsand it leads to more knowledge. In today’s knowledge economy money followsthose who have knowledge. Even if money does not follow you should not worry asthe process of acquiring knowledge is fun. After all the goal in life is tohave fun. Is it not?

Animals raised in enrichedenvironments—surrounded by other animals, objects to explore, toys to roll,ladders to climb, and running wheels— learn better than genetically identicalanimals that have been reared in impoverished environments. Acetylcholine, abrain chemical essential for learning, is higher in rats trained on difficultspatial problems than in rats trained on simpler problems. Mental training orlife in enriched environments increases brain weight by 5 percent in thecerebral cortex of animals and up to 9 percent in areas that the trainingdirectly stimulates. Trained or stimulated neurons develop 25 percent more branches andincrease their size, the number of connections per neuron , and their bloodsupply. These changes canoccur late in life,though they do not develop as rapidly in older animals as inyounger ones. Similar effects of training and enrichment on brain anatomy havebeen seen in all types of animals tested to date.

For people, postmortem examinations have shown thateducation increases the number of branches among neurons. An increased numberof branches drives the neurons farther apart, leading to an increase in thevolume and thickness of the brain. The idea that the brain is like a musclethat grows with exercise is not just a metaphor.

Antidote to Use it OR Loose it Tendency 

There isonly one effective antidote to this tendency and that is to use your skillsagain and again, without fail. Munger says, 'The right antidote to such a lossis to make use of the functional equivalent of the aircraft simulator employedin pilot training. This allows a pilot to continuously practice all of therarely used skills that he can't afford to lose.'
