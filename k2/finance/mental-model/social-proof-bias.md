Have youever been in a situation when you looked at the sky, or at something, justbecause someone else was staring there? Like in this image below…

Iremember playing a few of such pranks during school days, when a group of usfriends started looking at the sky and then giggling at passers-by following usin doing so. It’s another matter that I did not realize then that I was gettingthe passers-by to indulge in what psychologists call as…

 

Social Proof

As perWikipedia, social proof is…

…a psychological phenomenon where people assume the actions ofothers in an attempt to reflect correct behavior for a given situation. Thiseffect is prominent in ambiguous social situations where people are unable todetermine the appropriate mode of behavior, and is driven by the assumptionthat surrounding people possess more knowledge about the situation.

In simplewords, social proof is all about ‘what-you-think-I-think…what-you-do-I-do”.

A Brahminwas carrying a goat, which he got as a gift. Soon, in the jungle he met firstthief who said that it is a dog, he said what ?? No, its a goat, and then hemoved forward. Then came the second thief and he said the same thing, then evenbrahmin got confused and left his goat, assuming its a dog. And soon, thiefstole the goat away.

Laughter shows

Socialproof is what is at work in canned laughter – what you hear in comedy shows. The reason such laughter exists isit causes the audience to laugh longer and more often when humorous material ispresented and to rate the material as funnier.

 

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/533367A1-8052-4B45-8B28-828DDD8B00E5.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ojvMvz8ilXg/Vn5oQWFcNVI/AAAAAAAA5Uc/wheTvdE90XE/s1600/great-indian-laughter-show.png)

Business channel shows 

In fact,you will hear the laughter even when there’s nothing to laugh about. I proposethey add such laughter to business channels as well, so that people stressedhearing the experts can get a few laughs. :)

Socialproof applies especially to the way we decide what constitutes correctbehavior. We view a behavior as more correct in a given situation to the degreethat we see others performing it. Whether the question is what to do with anempty popcorn box in a movie theater, how fast to drive on a certain stretch ofhighway, or what to put on the plate at a dinner party, the actions of thosearound us will be important in defining the answer.

Socialproof works to both our advantage and disadvantage. When someone shouts “Bomb!”at a packed theater, it pays to run with others for safety without beinganalytical.

Socialproof also helps us find books we’ll like (Amazon reviews), restaurants to eatat (Zomato), and places to travel (TripAdvisor).

We don’tmake our decisions in a choice vacuum. Our social circles influence our actionsand our purchases, and that’s normal. Another example of social proof appearswhen you visit ‘Safal Niveshak’, where I have written more than 400 posts tillnow.

 

When is social proof most influential

Socialproof most influential under two conditions:

- Uncertainty and 
- doubt 

whenpeople are unsure, when the situation is ambiguous, they are more likely tocopy others.

Hardwired to Herd

Real painand social pain are felt in the same parts of the brain.

Chandlerwould make a good investor.

Being asuccessful investor requires not feeling any social pain by doing somethingthat's very unpopular...

We canget more wiser or more foolish by following the crowd…

When doesthe wisdom of the crowds becomes madness of the mobs? - for example usingamazon.in or imbd.com ratings for books or movies respectively. 

There aredomains where one is better off relying on the crowd

 

Professor Sanjay Bakshi on How to handle Wisdom ofCrowd

For me,its very useful to quickly zoom into the 10 most emailed articles on NYT.So,when it comes to reading news in NYT, I rely on the “wisdom of the crowds”

In somedomains wisdom of crowds works. In some (like ﬁnancial markets) it doesn’t.

 

“If youwant to have a better performance than the crowd, you must do thingsdifferently from the crowd.”

But whenit comes to investing, you are on a VERY different terrain...

 

“Peopleare always asking me where is the outlook good, but that’s the wrongquestion... “The right question is:Where is the outlook the most miserable? Icall this the Principle of Maximum Pessimism... “Let me explain how it works.In almost every activity of normal life people try to go where the outlook isthe best... “You look for a job in an industry with a good future, or build afactory where prospects are best. But my contention is if youare selectingpublicly traded investments, you have to do the opposite... “You’re trying tobuy a share at the lowest possible price in relation to what that corporationis worth... “And there is only one reason a share goes to a bargain price:Because other people are selling. There is no other reason... “To get a bargainprice, you’ve got to look for where the public is most frightened andpessimistic.”

Social Proof in Life

In Life:Want some excellent parenting advice you don't see in papers everyday? Listento Munger, 'Teenagers' parents usually learn more than they would like aboutteenagers' cognitive errors from the social-proof tendency. This phenomenon wasrecently involved in a breakthrough by Judith Rich Harris, who demonstratedthat superrespect by young people for their peers, rather than for parents orother adults, is ordained to some considerable extent by the genes of the youngpeople. This makes it wise for parents to rely more on manipulating the qualityof the peers than on exhortations to their own offspring.'

 

Social Proof in Corporations

Incorporations: The social- proof tendency is common in corporations too. Lessthan two months before the financial crisis of 2008, there was a mad rush tograb real estate in the suburbs of Mumbai. One particular plot of 178 acresbelonging to PAL-Peugeot in the Kalyan-Dombivili area saw 35 bidders thatcounted the who's who of real estate industry and included players like DLF,Indiabulls, Unitech, Omax, Akruti Nirman and the Hiranandani group.

The roleof outside directors is often debated in the media. It's not without cause.Outside directors are a checking mechanism in the boardroom. What happens inreality though is far from it. Recall that Satyam Computers had many prominentmembers of society on its board of directors at various times, yet none had anyidea of what was really going on in the company. Putting in Charlie Munger'swords, 'The outside directors on a corporate board usually display the nearultimate form of inaction. They fail to object to anything much short of an axemurder until some public embarrassment of the board finally causes theirintervention. A typical board-of-directors' culture was once well described bymy friend, Joe Rosenfield, as he said, 'They asked me if I wanted to become adirector of Northwest Bell, and it was the last thing they ever asked me'.'

 

How Managers (in company) Make Decisions

Socialproof also works at a bigger level…inside companies. That is what drives mostCEOs to act like their peers. So they will acquire companies just because acompetitor is doing so. And they will conduct accounting frauds just becausemany others are doing so!

 

FromBFBV:

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/8E1E4FF1-2022-2045-A5C8-C47F943FDF3B.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mLW0d0X14Ik/VoL3eFYOsEI/AAAAAAAA5lg/uLoWBtHEj5o/s1600/warren_buffet_explaining.png)

Most managers have very little incentive to make theintelligent-but-with-some-chance- of-looking-like-an-idiot decision. - Buffet

“Theirpersonal gain/loss ratio is all too obvious: if an unconventional decisionworks out well, they get a pat on the back and, if it works out poorly, theyget a pink slip. (Failing conventionally is the route to go; as a group,lemmings may have a rotten image, but no individual lemming has ever receivedbad press...

 

“JohnMaynard Keynes said in his masterful The General Theory: “Worldly wisdomteaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeedunconventionally.” (Or, to put it in less elegant terms, lemmings as a classmay be derided but never does an individual lemming get criticized.)”

 

So, allboils down to - Social Proof + Incentive Caused Bias.

 

Here iswhat Warren Buffett wrote to his managers in September 2006, when his peers incorporate America were all under the spell of social proof to justify theirmisdoings…

The five most dangerous words in business may be “Everybody else isdoing it.” A lot of banks and insurance companies have suffered earningsdisasters after relying on that rationale.

Even worse have been the consequences from using that phrase tojustify the morality of proposed actions. More than 100 companies so far havebeen drawn into the stock option backdating scandal and the number is sure togo higher. My guess is that a great many of the people involved would not havebehaved in the manner they did except for the fact that they felt others weredoing so as well. The same goes for all of the accounting gimmicks tomanipulate earnings – and deceive investors – that has taken place in recentyears.

You would have been happy to have as an executor of your will oryour son-in-law most of the people who engaged in these ill-conceivedactivities. But somewhere along the line they picked up the notion – perhapssuggested to them by their auditor or consultant – that a number ofwell-respected managers were engaging in such practices and therefore it mustbe OK to do so. It’s a seductive argument.

But it couldn’t be more wrong. In fact, every time you hear thephrase “Everybody else is doing it” it should raise a huge red flag. Why wouldsomebody offer such a rationale for an act if there were a good reasonavailable? Clearly the advocate harbors at least a small doubt about the act ifhe utilizes this verbal crutch.

Social Proof and Investing

Socialproof also works in stock market investing.

Why doyou think most of us are always on the lookout for others’ opinions on onlineforums on the stocks we own or want to own?

 

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/DD4429E0-F5F5-1140-B882-815C5FE5E079.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4VFElt810_g/Vn5oiec9urI/AAAAAAAA5U0/iVxsyBIX6sM/s1600/investing_forums-mmb-messageboard.png)

Socialproof is the reason you will find most fund managers owing similar stocks intheir portfolios. The thinking is – “If I outperform, I will be a star…but if Iunderperform, I will be like others!” But then, Somerset Maugham said, “If 40 million people say a foolish thing,it does not become a wise one.”

You willscold your child who misbehaves and then says, “But everybody else is doingit.” Have you ever scolded yourself for investing like everyone else is doing?

 

3 Kinds of Social Proof in Investing

Thereare three types of social proof that impact investors’ decisions – and that you should be very careful of:

\1. Television “Experts”: 24×7 televisionbusiness channels like CNBC have turned investing into a game of sound bites.

Switch onthe channel any time during the day (or night) and you will find talking headsand experts spew out their strategies to making money. Every strategy will bedifferent and each one will promise to make you a lot of money if followed.

I’veseen a lot of people – even afew otherwise sensible investors – fall prey to such strategies and lose their money and good night’ssleep. They speculated in stocks just because someone on TV, posing as anexpert, was speculating on that stock.

 

[![img](file:////Users/kchandra/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/A9B5CAF3-6FCC-EF4C-8D76-6EE8A07090C8.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n0NNI7IZbAE/Vn5omW3Lg7I/AAAAAAAA5U8/QiREE7CouCQ/s1600/cnbc_experts-tulsiani.jpg)

It’sa trap, dear friend, to invest in a stock just because an “expert” is doing so.You may know from your personal experience. 2. Peer Investors: I’ve seen a lot ofinvestors get their investment advice at the gym or at work when a friendshares what he or she has been buying.

Interestingly,when people talk about their investments, they usually talk only about theirlarge gains. But, even if those claims are true (and they’re hard to verify),it’s difficult for others to profit on those recommendations because the stocksor mutual funds in question have already gone up.

If you’veever read the comments on investing blogs or stock forums, you’ve probably seensimilarly smart-seeming peer advice – “I bought this and it doubled!”

Funny,but you never hear about the picks they got wrong, do you?

It’s thusimportant to avoid reading stock forums and especially picking your stocks fromthere.

\3. Wisdom of the Crowds: When McDonald’s claims“Over 1 Million Served,” the message people take away is that, somehow, such alarge number of people couldn’t have made a wrong eating choice. So they mustbe right.

Stocksand mutual funds are similar. Certain stocks and mutual funds have almostcult-like followings.

Themassive hype creates a very positive aura around these investments, but a lotof hype doesn’t mean these are necessarily the best funds to buy at all times.

From South Sea to Reliance Power

Iremember attending the pre-IPO meet of Reliance Power in early 2008, as thecompany was coming out with India’s largest IPO ever.

At thedais, alongside Mr. Ambani was a “respected” investment banker who had workedon this public issue. What I heard this investment banker promising toinvestors and brokers who were attending the meet was shocking.

“The IPOwill more than double your money on the listing day!” he announced as if he hadseen the future. A large number of people stood up and applauded thisstatement, and similar other promises made during that meet.

I know ofhow people sold off their other stocks and assets to apply to the ReliancePower IPO (some were my distant family members!). Everyone wanted to get a pieof the IPO not just because the “stock was expected to double on listing day”but also because “everyone else was also applying”!

When Iadvised people to avoid the IPO at all costs, I heard statements like…

- “You have lost your head!     This is a sure-shot winner.” 
- “Everyone would me making     money on this IPO, so I don’t want to miss out.” 
- “So many people have made     money on previous IPOs that I had avoided. Not this one!” 

Anyways,what followed is in front of us…

Allstock market bubbles – like theone you saw in the Harshad Mehta days, or Ketan Parikh days, the dotcom boom,and the real estate boom – are caused by social proof as everyone wants to actand invest like everyone else. You must have seen several such instances inyour investing life as well, when people around you were buying or sellingstocks just because “everyone else was doing so”.

You musthave yourself fallen into this trap, haven’t you?

Well,that’s how social proof works in investing. It explains why most of us buy highand sell low (because “most” of us are doing so!).

 

How are we to blame?

Thespeculative public is incorrigible. In financial terms it cannot count beyond3. It will buy anything, at any price, if there seems to be some"action" in progress. It will fall for any company identified with"franchising," computers, electronics, science, technology, or whathave you, when the particular fashion is raging. – Ben Graham

 

 “This is a world inhabited not by people who have to bepersuaded to believe but by people who want an excuse to believe.”- JohnKenneth Galbraith

Peoplewant to latch on to just about any reason to do what they have already decidedto do…But what about money managers? Why do they behave like sheep? Or ratherlike zebras?

 

How Fund Managers Behave

 

Do youthink your mutual fund manager knows a lot and uses only his intelligence topick up stocks? Well, fund managers are also human beings and are affected bysocial proof.

WarrenBuffett writes…

Most managers have very little incentive to make theintelligent-but-with-some-chance-of- looking-like-an-idiot decision. Theirpersonal gain/loss ratio is all too obvious: if an unconventional decisionworks out well, they get a pat on the back and, if it works out poorly, theyget a pink slip. (Failing conventionally is the route to go; as a group,lemmings may have a rotten image, but no individual lemming has ever receivedbad press.)

Here is how a fund manager thinks – “It really doesn’t matter a lot to me what happens to thisblue-chip stock as long as everyone has it and we all go down together. But onthe other hand, I cannot afford to try for large gains on unfamiliar stocks,which would leave me open to criticism if the idea fails.

Thisexplains why for a very long period, only a handful of mutual funds beat thebroader markets. Everyone is trying to do exactly like others are doing andthus most come out with less than average results.

How to Overcome Social Proof - Keep in Mind

How toget over the social proof tendency?

Here issome advice from Peter Bevelin’s “Seeking Wisdom”…

- The 19th Century     American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson said: “It is easy in the     world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live     after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps     with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.” 
- What is popular is     not always right. If you don’t like what other people are doing, don’t do     it. Warren Buffett says: “We derive no comfort because     important people, vocal people, or great numbers of people agree with us.     Nor do we derive comfort if they don’t.” 
- Disregard what     others are doing and think for yourself. Ask: Does this make sense?     Remember the advice from Benjamin Graham, the dean of financial analysis –     “Have the courage of your knowledge and experience. If you have     formed a conclusion from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound,     act on it – even though others may hesitate or differ. You are neither     right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. You are right     because your data and reasoning are right.”

One of the best ways to brace yourself frombeing a victim of social proof is to choose your role models carefully. Yourheroes can serve as reference points for making a decision about our ownbehaviour.

Guy Spier, author of the book The Education ofa Value Investor, shares a wonderful strategy in his book:

“here is a wisdom here that goes farbeyond the narrow world of investing. What I’m about to tell you may be thesingle most important secret I have discovered in all my decades of studyingand stumbling…What I stumbled upon was this. Desperate to figure out how tolead a life that was more like his [Warren Buffett], I began constantly to askmyself one simple question:

“What would Warren Buffett do if hewere in my shoes?”…The minute I started mirroring Buffett, my life changed. Itwas as if I had tuned in to a different frequency.”

So find out your heroes and populate yourthoughts with them.

For the second strategy to counter the force ofsocial proof, let’s take Mark Twain’s help who said:

Whenever you find yourself on theside of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.

Mr. Twain is essentially asking us to become anindependent and rational thinker. Both, Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett, areruthlessly independent in their thought process and decision making.

Taking a contrarian position isn’t an ironrule. Don’t take pride in being contrarian just for the sake of it. WarrenBuffett simplifies it further :

We derive no comfort becauseimportant people, vocal people, or great numbers of people agree with us. Nordo we derive comfort if they don’t.

Would you sell your brand new car if some ofyour neighbours came to you and started offering 30 percent less than yourpurchase price? Of course not. You know the real worth of your car and sellingit at a price quoted by Mr. Neighbour (a close cousin of Mr. Market) isn’t awise decision. So why would you do that with you stocks?

Benjamin Graham, the highest authority onsecurity analysis, reminds us :

You’re neither right nor wrongbecause the crowd disagrees with you. You are right because your data andreasoning are right.

Checklist is another great tool to saveyourself from social proof tendency. The catch is that you have to create thechecklist beforehand. When the whole world (crowd) is stampeding in onedirection, checklist can bring some sanity in your decision making process. Forthat matter, checklist saves you from hosts of other behavioural biases alsolike hindsight bias, anchoring, confirmation bias, liking tendency, etc.

And last but not the least, tune out theunnecessary noise i.e. the newspapers and news channels. More than any realinformation they just resound the “market sentiments” which is nothing butherding. Just because somebody is on the TV, who is articulate and wears abusiness suit, doesn’t mean he is a superior thinker and has valuable insights.

Conclusion

Here's a piece of advice from Munger. 'If only one lesson is to bechosen from a package of lessons involving the social-proof tendency, and usedin self-improvement, my favorite would be: Learn how to ignore the examplesfrom others when they are wrong, because few skills are more worth having.'

Conformityoften results from uncertainty. In situations where we aren’t sure what to do,we conform to popular choice. But when the stakes are high, you don’t want tobe in a situation where you’re unsure because that would trigger the force ofherding.

Becomingan independent thinker may not earn you popularity but it surely will make youwealthy over long term.

So far wehave looked at about thirty mental models from various disciplines. Teaching isa nice hack for learning and my own understanding has improved a lot whileteaching these mental models.

A wiseman once said, “The school education will help you earn a living, butself-education will make you a fortune.”

I don’tfeel that there is something evil with traditional educationsystems but it looks like a series of hurdles that one needs to jump to achievesomething in life. They are pretty good in doing what they were originallydesigned to do – to mass produce skilled workers who would become veryefficient cogs in the wheel.

But onceyou realize the limitation of such education, you will naturally gravitatetowards the idea of self-education.

Selfeducation starts the day when you start designing your own study curriculum. Acurriculum which doesn’t get over in few semesters; there are no grades (exceptthe one you award yourself) and no project submission deadlines (excluding theones you set for yourself).

Vishaland I don’t work with deadlines. We set live-lines. It’s the time we giveourselves to inject life into our work. Live-line sounds much more excitingthan deadline. The quest for multidisciplinary learning is serious but notdead-serious.

CharlieMunger demands for multidisciplinary worldly wisdom. His prescription forseekers is to start by learning the big ideas from the big disciplines. Andself education is the only way through to become little wiser to deal withworldly affairs.

If you’vebeen following the Latticework series, I would say you’re already on the righttrack to acquire the worldly wisdom.

Take care and keep learning.
