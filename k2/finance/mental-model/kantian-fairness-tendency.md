Definition

Thistendency refers to our inclination to be treated fairly and the problems thatnot being treated fairly can cause. When people expect fair behaviour but donot get it, that gives rise to hostility. 

 

Thismodel was mentioned by Mr. Munger in the revised version of his essay titled“The Psychology of Human Misjudgment”. This essay is one of several essayscontained in “[Poor Charlie’s Almanac](http://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/index.html)“.

Ibelieve Mr. Munger was referring to man’s overlove of fairness for all, oftenresulting in bad outcomes for humanity. Earlier, he had made a reference tothis subject in his UCSB [talk](https://fundooprofessor.wordpress.com/2005/09/30/explaining-mr-mungers-kantian-fairness-tendency/www.tilsonfunds.com/MungerUCSBspeech.pdf) .

 

Thetendency comes from Immanuel Kant, a German philosopher of the 1700s.

 

Munger says, 'Kant was famous for his 'categorical imperative,' asort of 'golden rule' that required humans to follow those behaviour patternsthat, if followed by all others, would make the surrounding human system workbest for everybody. And it is not too much to say that modern acculturated mandisplays, and expects from others, a lot of fairness as thus defined byKant.'[Found in: Expectations of fairness]

 

I wasalmost at the end of a beautiful evening drive. Refreshing cold breeze gentlyblowing on my face through the car windows coupled with minuscule traffic waslike heaven on earth. Sporting an ear-to-ear smile I felt confident thatnothing in the world had the power to take away my inner peace at that moment.But, as usual, my faithful and ever reliable nemesis, the chaos-monkey, haddifferent plans for me that evening.

Justwhen I was about to take a smooth turn on a closing traffic signal, a taxi cutme off while overtaking my car. The surprising rash maneuver from the taxicalled for sudden brakes and by that time signal had turned red. As a result Imissed my turn because of the insensitive driving by the taxi driver.

In thenext few seconds, my Buddha smile turned into an angry frown and I was thrownout of my “appreciating the good things in life” mode.

Why didI feel so agitated? Well, for one, I was ahead of the taxi and it was me whowas supposed to cross the signal first.

I feltas if the taxi guy had brutally robbed off my well deserved right to take theturn before him. You might find it amusing but the incident costed me awhopping two minutes of extra wait for the traffic signal to turn green againand of course my inner peace.

“Hey,cool down buddy! You’re exaggerating and using pretty strong words to describea petty incident.” Probably this is what you would have said in an attempt topacify me if you were with me that day.

But howcould I take it easy? It was absolutely unfair! Why unfair?

Dounto others as you would have done unto you. Sounds familiar? Well I wouldnever have done the same thing (it’s pretty close to encroachment in mydictionary) to anybody else.

Probablythe taxi driver didn’t really think it was unfair. Perhaps he’d been at thereceiving end of the same treatment many times in the past that he nowconsidered it fair to pass the buck. Or may be he was just too busy marvellingat his own driving skills. Who knows what he was thinking!

Well,before you lose interest and stop reading, let me put an end to my rant abouttraffic manners and being a victim of unfair treatment. I hope you would’veguessed by now that our mental model for today has got something to do with theabove incident.

So letme ask you this. Have you ever experienced this feeling of being treatedunfairly? May be in some small way like when one of your utterly undeservingcolleague got promoted before you. Ouch, I’ve been there! ;)

 

Kantian Fairness Tendency

Whyis the human psyche so obsessed with the idea of fairness? Actually, it’s not justhumans. Even monkey business (literally) isn’t immune to this tendency. Checkout the video below (or [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meiU6TxysCg)), which proves that the tendency to seek fairness in alltransactions is not an invention of modern man, but the behaviour has beentattooed at a much deeper level by evolutionary process.

 

Thetheory about rational human beings takes the view that people would accept anyoffer made to them as long as they were better off. But we know that humans areanything but rational and many [studies](http://www.economist.com/node/9433782) have shown that people will reject offers they view as unfair. Ourape just validated this hypothesis in the video. This is the matter ofdiscussion for today. Exploring the idea of what Charlie Munger calls Kantian Fairness Tendency. It’s one of the big ideas from Philosophy.

Let’sdefine fairness first. The basic idea is that we have devised certain rules that,when followed by everyone, result in a pretty smooth life for all involved. Thekey is that everyone needs to follow along. This unsaid understanding about‘following along’ few ‘socially acceptable guidelines for conduct’ is whatconstructs the framework for fairness.

Whena behaviour doesn’t fall (or doesn’t seem to fall) in this framework, we labelit as unfair.

FromCharlie’s talk, it’s not entirely clear why he has used the word Kantian but let mestill take a stab at it. The word refers to the philosophical framework createdby eighteenth century German philosopher Immanuel Kant.

Kant’s ethics are founded on his view of rationality as the ultimategood and his belief that all people are fundamentally rational beings. (Source:Wikipedia)

Sosomebody who uses Kant’s philosophy to construct an idea about fairness isprobably suffering from Kantian Fairness tendency.

Nowpassing a judgement on ‘what is fair’ seems pretty simple when you are thesubject matter i.e., when you are evaluating the fairness in matters involvingyou. What about the case when you have to take a decision about ‘what is fair’for a third person?

BeforeI start pouring out my own ideas, I would like to mention that [Prof. Sanjay Bakshi](http://www.safalniveshak.com/fundoo-professor-sanjay-bakshi/) has already compiledsome of his thoughts on this topic in his blog post (which goes all the wayback to year 2005). His discussion about ‘the law of higher good’ is anothermental model that you need to be aware of. It kind of resolves the dilemma posedby Kantian Fairness Tendency. Don’t miss his [blog post](https://fundooprofessor.wordpress.com/2005/09/30/explaining-mr-mungers-kantian-fairness-tendency/) since it covers a lot ofground for getting a better grip on the fallacy of Kantian Fairness Tendency. Ihave borrowed some of the quoted text from the same blog post.

 

Fairness and Envy

If youlook at the monkey’s behaviour in the above video, it’s clear that the rewardfor performing a task is perfectly fair and acceptable to the monkey until thepoint he sees that his other monkey friend (I am just making an innocent guessabout their friendship; they could have been professional rivals too) isgetting a better reward for the same task. Of course, at this point, the firstmonkey goes berserk. He just can’t believe it. He is boiling with anger. Acomplete pandemonium follows in his cage.

Myguess is that this extreme reaction against lack of fairness is because of [envy](http://www.safalniveshak.com/comparison-is-a-trap/), another mental model which we will discuss in detail some othertime. However, Kantian Fairness Tendency limits the behaviour to accepting orrejecting the offered deal, whereas envy takes it to the next level (i.e., theemotional outburst) which could, and definitely would, get you into trouble.

Youcould say that a distorted worldview about fairness becomes the precursor toenvious behaviour. That explains where the roots of envy lie.

 

Seeking Fairness

In theTV news when you see a guy robbing a lady, the obvious first thought is to seekpunishment for the culprit. But soon the news reporter reveals that the thief’smother was ill and he needed money for her treatment. Does this justifyrobber’s act as fair? May be yes. But then, is it fair to the society as awhole that anybody who needs money for a genuine cause is allowed to robstrangers?

Asusual, Charlie Munger has some insights to deal with such situations. He hasspoken about man’s overlove of fairness in his UCSB talk. He said –

It is not always recognized that, to function best, morality shouldsometimes appear unfair, like most worldly outcomes. The craving for perfectfairness causes a lot of terrible problems in system function. Some systemsshould be made deliberately unfair to individuals because they’ll be fairer onaverage for all of us. I frequently cite the example of having your careerover, in the Navy, if your ship goes aground, even if it wasn’t your fault. Isay the lack of justice for the one guy that wasn’t at fault is way more thanmade up by a greater justice for everybody when every captain of a ship alwayssweats blood to make sure the ship doesn’t go aground. Tolerating a littleunfairness to some to get a greater fairness for all is a model I recommend toall of you. But again, I wouldn’t put it in your assigned college work if youwant to be graded well, particularly in a modern law school wherein there isusually an over-love of fairness-seeking process.

 

Lookingat the idea of fairness in isolation is akin to saying that a surgeon shouldrefuse to operate on a patient because it will cause pain to him. Of course, anoperation will cause pain (after the anesthesia wears out) and few days ofinconvenience, but eventually it will prove to be a beneficial act for thepatient.

So, maybe, seeking fairness isn’t always wrong. What you have to know is – at whatlevel are you seeking fairness? At an individual level, or at a group level, orat some other level altogether. Answering that question would bring someclarity as to what is fair and what isn’t.

Isuggest you watch this [lecture fromMichael Sandel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdfcR-8hEY) who is a professor in HarvardUniversity. Some of the thought experiments that he discusses in his lectureare so unsettling that it seriously challenged my long held notions aboutmorality and fairness.

 

Thefollowing story is from an [article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-trick-the-guilty-and-gullible-into-revealing-themselves-1399680248) I read in Wall Street Journal –During the middle ages in Europe when the court couldn’t determine if adefendant was guilty they would offer him an option. The option was to eitheraccept the punishment for their crime or put their hand in boiling water. Theidea was that God, who knew the truth, would miraculously save any suspect whohad been wrongly accused.

Thetrick however was that a guilty person and an innocent one often responddifferently to the same incentive. Typically a guilty would choose to acceptthe punishment instead of sacrificing his hand. An innocent who believed in Godwould daringly agree for boiling water test.

In theideal scenario, nobody really goes through the boiling water test, because thedefendants are proven guilty/innocent based on their intentions only.

But ifnobody was ever made to go through the boiling water test in front of thecrowd, the trick will lose its effectiveness. People need to at least see somedefendants suffering the boiling water torture to believe in the authenticityof the test. Which means some innocent people will have to go through thetorture and it would be unfair to them. In order to keep the sanity and orderin society few innocents will end up being victim of unfair play.

Inother words, to make an omelette you need to break some eggs. :)

 

Impact of Fairness

InLife: The Kantian behaviour can be found in even mundane acts, says Munger. 'Ina small community having a one-way bridge or tunnel for autos, it is the normin the United States to see a lot of reciprocal courtesy, despite the absenceof signs or signals. And many freeway drivers, including myself, will often letother drivers come in front of them, in lane changes or the like, because thatis the courtesy they desire when roles are reversed. Moreover, there is, inmodern human culture, a lot of courteous lining up by strangers so that all areserved on a 'first-come-first-served' basis.'

 

 

Fairness in Investing

Ininvesting: Kantian tendency comes into play in investing when companies actagainst minority shareholders. A number of foreign MNCs operating in India haveindulged in practices not in the interests of minority shareholders. Some ofthe methods include: paying a higher royalty to foreign parent company as [HUL](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/stocks/snapshot.asp?code=1572) did, even in the face of fallingvolume growth or merging of an unlisted subsidiary at high valuations ([Akzo Nobel](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/stocks/snapshot.asp?code=1623)) or transfer of profitabledivision to the parent company at lower valuations ([Siemens](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/stocks/snapshot.asp?code=3656)) or transfer of core business toan unlisted subsidiary of the parent ([Maruti](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/stocks/snapshot.asp?code=6442)).

Thisbehaviour becomes a problem for investors when companies decide to take suchactions with disregard towards minority shareholders. Such companies shouldbetter be avoided.

 

One ofthe ways this bias comes into play in investing is when people expect that theyshould make the money in the same way they lost it, i.e., they focus onindividual stocks to make money for them.

Ofcourse, that’s what the idea is when you choose the stock to begin with. Butexpecting fairness in returns from the stock is a fallacy. Instead, you shouldmake sure that you don’t lose money overall on your portfolio of stocks. Nomatter how much margin of safety and rigorous analysis you employ, you arebound to find (time to time) that you have a loser in your portfolio.

Anatural reaction is to say, “It’s not fair. I have put in so much effort,analysis and money in this stock. It shouldn’t lose money.”

Beingaware of Kantian Fairness Tendency can save you some unwanted heartache.

Nowconsider, for instance, a company that has historically paid good dividends toshareholders. As time goes on, if the company continues to grow and performwell, shareholders may rightly expect that their dividend should grow, too. Butwhat if it doesn’t? What if something changes, maybe a slowdown in growth, orpressure on cash flows? And what if the company decides to cut back ondividends to preserve cash for future expansion?

Considerthe example of Hawkins Cookers, which recently cut its dividend from Rs 60 pershare in FY14 to Rs 45 in FY15 due to slowdown in growth and pressure on cashflows.

“It’sunfair!” lot of investors in the stock seem to be saying. “Did we pay 60x forthis?”

And,when a lot of investors start singing the unfair song, this is what happens to thestock –

Onthe surface, this may seem fair on the part of the management, who wants toprotect precious cash that would help them tide over the immediate slowdown inbusiness. And given the management of Hawkins, it surely seems to be thinkinglong term. But to most people who bought the stock with unfair expectations,it’s the management and the business that now looks unfair to them! Conclusion

Lifeisn’t fair, but many can’t accept this. Tolerating a little unfairness shouldbe okay if it means a greater fairness for all. However the question ‘what istruly fair for all’ isn’t an easy one to answer.

BeforeI end this discussion let me put up a caveat emptor. Some of my thoughts in thisarticle have been a result of my speculation about the utility of KantianFairness Tendency.

Thereis a non-zero possibility that my arguments and conclusions are flawed, soinstead of taking them at face value, please consider them as starting pointsto stimulate your own independent thought process.

Goeswithout saying that I would be more than happy to entertain any challengingarguments from your side too. So don’t hesitate! Just shoot your thoughts inthe Comments section of this post.

Everybodyshould believe in something. I believe in having fun and I am having loads ofit by sharing these ideas with you.

Don’tbreak this chain of acquiring worldly wisdom. Pass it on. You will be surprisedwith the kind of insights that pop up in your head while you’re explaining newideas to other people.

AlthoughI have tried my best to compile some useful knowledge in this article, but itmight so happen that the real intellectual action takes place in the Commentssection. So please don’t forget to share your insights there.

Takecare and keep learning.
