## Effective RxJava

This is a collection of items, each specifying one general rule, to help you write [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) code more effectively. It is modeled after two of my favorite technical books, _Effective C++_ and _Effective Java_. I appreciate not only the soundness of their contents, but the brevity of their writing style. I hope that Effective RxJava has the same value proposition.

For each rule I've attempted to provide relevant example code -- most of which is currently in production in the [Khan Academy Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.khanacademy.android).
