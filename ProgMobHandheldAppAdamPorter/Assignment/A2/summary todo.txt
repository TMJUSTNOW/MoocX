Hello all,

These are some points to be considered while solving the assignment:

    Make sure that you download the updated version of the files
    You are going to submit 3 txt files contains the logcat output
    There is no source code to be submit
    to import the app in the eclipse use (File -> Import -> Android -> Existing Android Code Into Workspace ->browse for the sourcefiles directory ) but don't forget to extract the files first
    Follow the instruction carefully as mentioned in the writeup.pdf, e.g:
        use Log.i
        for the Log.i first argument, use the "TAG" which declared in the source code
        for the second argument, use the string "Entered the xxx method " where xxx is the name of the method like onCreate()
        be aware that the method name start with lowercase "o"
        use Galaxy Nexus AVD with API level 18(if you don't have this API download it from the SDK manager)
        filter the logcat by the tag"Lab-Activity"
        You must start the application with your device in Portrait mode
    after you run the test cases one at time make sure that the lifecycle in the logcat make sense that means it start with onCreate, end with onDestroy
    if the logcat doesn't start with onCreate try to force close the app from settings before running the test
    if the logcat end with onPause rather than onDestroy try to add this line to the TearDown method in each testi.java Thread.sleep(5000);
    if there is still an error when you submit the files, check your source code of the activityOne and activityTwo classes and make sure everything is all right
    As an additional check, the correct output should have the following number of log statements for test1, test2 and test3 respectively 18 , 29 , 28
