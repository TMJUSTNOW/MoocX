Welcome to the last coding quiz before the project. We want to calculate this time is the UpdatedState X and the UpdatedCovariance matrix P. We need a lot of pre-calculated data this time. These are the predicted sigma points in the state space. This is the predicted state mean and the state prediction covariance. You can use this variable x again, and override it later with the updated state. The same is true for the variable p, override this one with the updated covariance matrix. Here we have the predicted sigma points in the measurement space. This is the predicted measurement mean and this is the covariance of the measurement prediction. And of course, you need some values for the actual measurement z. Here you can store your intermediate results for the cross correlation matrix t. Again, make sure to use the variable x and the variable P to store your updated state and your updated covariance matrix. All right, good luck with this final coding quiz.
