In this quiz, we have two objects we want to calculate. The mean predicted state X and the state prediction covariance P. This time we started the point but we already have the predicted sigma points. This is a vector where you can put them the weights for the sigma points. This is the vector for the predicted state mean and this is the metrics for the state prediction conversions. Good luck with this quiz.
