It's really great to see you made it all the way through this challenging lesson. In the project description, you will find everything you need to know to successfully complete the project. In this video, I would like to point out some things about the UKR I find quite remarkable. And I also want to explain why a common filter in general is such an important tool for self driving cars. Let's have a look at the scenario on the project. You have seen a similar plot before in the EKF project. We see here a bicycle that is first driving straight and then turning into a circle. The path of the bicycle is shown in blue. The green line is the sequence of all measurements we receive both from LiDAR and radar. As before, these measurements are quite noisy. The orange dots are the estimation resource of the UKF fusing laser and radar measurements. Remember, the linear process model in the last project had problems following the turn. The CTR model we're using this time follows the turn quite nicely, and still provides a smooth position estimate. You can play around with the process noise values, and make the estimation even smoother. Or force it to follow the measurements quicker. When you change the process noise values, also make sure to check the consistency of your filter. This is how the consistency check of my filter looks like. What you see here in orange are the NIS values of the three dimensional radar measurements. I also plotted the 95% line in blue. Just as expected, a small number if NIS values exceed this line. If your NIS values look like this, you know you have set up a consistent filter. This is how the NIS values of the laser measurements look like. Be aware that the 95% line is at a different level in this case because the laser measurement is a two dimensional vector. The project description will give you details about the exact criteria for a successful consistency check. Remember if the UKF is consistent, it means it provides a realistic covariance metrics. The UKF also estimates the velocity of the bicycle of course. It can do it with or without radar. But if you compare these two options, you will find out that the velocity estimate converges much faster if you use the radar too. Give it a try and switch on and off both sensors, and see how they contribute in different ways. What I find really impressive is how precise the UKF can estimate the orientation of the bicycle. None of our sensors is able to directly observe the orientation, but we still get a precise estimate. Even the yaw rate can be estimated providing useful results. For autonomous vehicles, the yaw rate of other vehicles is very important to know. Imagine another car starting to change lanes or a bicycle in front of you wants to do a left turn. Hopefully, they would both signalize their intention but in the end the yaw rate is the ultimate indicator for such a behavior prediction. Let's summarize the three most important probabilities of the UKF as a centrifusion tool for self driving cars. Number one, the UKF, you will be able to take noisy measurement data as input and provide a smooth position and velocity estimation of dynamic objects around you, without introducing a delay. Number two, you can provide an estimation of the orientation and the yaw rate of other vehicles using sensors that can't even directly observe these things. And number three, in addition to that, the UKF also give information on how precise the result is. Because it always provides a covariance matrix for every estimation. And you know that this covariance matrix is realistic if the UKF performs a consistency check. The uncertainty of the estimation result is very important for self driving cars. Because if the position of your leading vehicle is quite uncertain at some time, you better keep a little more distance
