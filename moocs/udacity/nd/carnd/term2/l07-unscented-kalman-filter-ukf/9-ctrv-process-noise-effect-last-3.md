How does the noise vector affect
the overall process model?

Let's do this again row for row starting
from the bottom with the yaw rate.

Assuming the yaw
acceleration new sin delta

is constant between k and k plus one.

It will just linearly add up to
the yaw rate with increasing time.

So,the influence of the yaw
acceleration on the yaw rate

is the yaw acceleration times delta t.

Can you calculate the influence of
the noise processes as new a and

new sin delta on the yaw angle and
the velocity.

Consider that the longitudinal
acceleration, u,

a is also constant constant
between k and k plus one.
