This time your goal is to predict the sigma points. So we start from a point where we already have the augmented sigma points. Let's quickly repeat the meaning of each of these points. This column is one sigma point. We have here a value for the position x. For the position y, for the velocity v, for the yaw angle psi, and for the yaw rate psi dot. This value is the longitudinal acceleration noise mu a. And this value is the yaw acceleration noise mu psi dot dot. The noise values are mostly 0. But not for all sigma points, as you can see here. Make sure to also put these two noise values correctly into the process model. This is the matrix you want to fill with with the predicted sigma points. And, of course, you need delta_t if you want to calculate numbers. The main thing you have to do here is implement the CTR remodel into C++ code. Make sure to also consider the effect of the process modes, and to catch division by zero. All right, good luck.
