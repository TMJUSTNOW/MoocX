# Vehicle Models

One approach to writing a good controller is to first model the vehicle's dynamics and constraints. That way we can analyze and tune the controller more efficiently. We will learn how to do this using **Vehicle Models** to mathematically describe how a vehicle moves.

We will work with a relatively simple type of model called a kinematic model. Kinematic models ignore many elements like gravity and tire forces, but they're relatively simple to work with and they often perform well. We will also work with dynamic models which capture more realistic forces and accelerations.
