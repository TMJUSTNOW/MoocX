# Actuator Constraints

We now know how to model the dynamics for a vehicle. However, in a real vehicle, actuators are limited by the design of the vehicle and fundamental physics. For example, a vehicle cannot have a steering angle of 90 degrees, so we shouldn't even consider these kinds of inputs. There is actually a vocabulary for describing this kind of constraint: we call this model **nonholonomic** because the vehicle can't move in arbitrary directions, it's limited by steering angle constraints. We can solve this by setting lower and upper bounds for the actuators. For example, we might set the steering angle to be between -30 and 30 degrees, and the acceleration to be between -1 and 1. -1 meaning full brake, and 1 meaning full acceleration. In practice the upper and lower bounds should mimic the actual vehicle as closely as possible.
