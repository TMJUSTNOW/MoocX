# Length & Duration

The prediction horizon is the duration over which future predictions are made. Weâ€™ll refer to this as **T**.

**T** is the product of two other variables, **N** and **dt**

**N** is the number of timesteps in the horizon. **dt** is how much time elapses between actuations. For example, if **N** were 20 and **dt** were 0.5, then **T** would be 10 seconds.

**N**, **dt**, and **T** are hyperparameters you will need to tune for each model predictive controller you build. However, there are some general guidelines. **T** should be as large as possible, while **dt** should be as small as possible.

These guidelines create tradeoffs

### Horizon

In the case of driving a car, **T** should be a few seconds, at most. Beyond that horizon, the environment will change enough that it won't make sense to predict any further into the future.

### Number of Timesteps

The goal of Model Predictive Control is to optimize the control inputs: **delta**, **a**. An optimizer will tune these inputs until a low cost vector of control inputs is found. The length of this vector is determined by **N**:

```
[delta_1, a_1, delta_2, a_2, ..., delta_n-1, a_n-1]
```

Thus **N** determines the number of variables optimized by the MPC. This is also a major driver of computational cost.

### Timestep Duration

MPC attempts to approximate a continues reference trajectory by means of discrete paths between actuations. Larger values of **dt** result in less frequent actuations, which makes it harder to accurately approximate a continuous reference trajectory. This is sometimes called "discretization error".

A good approach to setting **N**, **dt**, and **T** is to first determine a reasonable range for **T** and then tune **dt** and **N** appropriately, keeping the effect of each in mind.

The blue line is the reference trajectory and the red line the trajectory computed by Model Predictive Control. In this example the horizon has 7 steps, **N**, and the space in between white pebbles signifies the time elapsed, **dt**.
