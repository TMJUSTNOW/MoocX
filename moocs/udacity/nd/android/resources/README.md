## [Mobile Cloud Computing Specialization (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing2/36?utm_medium=listingPage)
A series of 6 courses that cover mobile and cloud computing, culminating in a Capstone project. Dr. Porter (the Android instructor) based his course on materials he originally created at UMD, [and open-sourced here](https://learn-android.appspot.com/preview).
