It may not surprise you that as humans we use short cuts to help us make
decisions. Heuristics are mental short cuts that we use to help us make complex
decisions and judgments, and they often result in quick and efficient
decisions. Now, we'll talk about two main types of heuristics. The first is
representativeness heuristic. And here, we make estimates on the probability of
an event based on how typical or representative it is of anther event. And the
second, is the availability heuristic. And we use this strategy, we rely on the
ease with which estimates some to mind, or how aware we're of those estimates.
But lets go to Lauren for a question on the availability heuristic.
