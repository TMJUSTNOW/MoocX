For those of you who speak more
than one language, think about this:
are there ideas or concepts
that you know in one language,
but that have no equivalent
in another language? Yes or no?
And for those of you
who speak only one language,
are there ideas and thoughts that you have
trouble putting into words? Yes or no?
Choose the answer,
to whichever question applies to you.
