What did you come up with for your answers? Hopefully, you had zero major
decisions that you had to make today. As for the number of minor decisions, I
started counting and lost track well after 35. In addition to decisions, we
also have judgments that we make throughout the day. So when we say things
like, it is unlikely, or chances are, or even I decided, we are judging how
likely something is to happen. That is, its probability.
