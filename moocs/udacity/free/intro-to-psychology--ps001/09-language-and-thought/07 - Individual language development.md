Now let's go back to the individual. So just how is it that we're able to
develop language? We see that children have the ability to understand words
before they develop the ability to produce words. Do you remember from lesson
three that the Wernicke's area is in the left hemisphere of the brain? And this
is where language comprehension occurs. In the Broca's area, which is also in
the left hemisphere of the brain, is associated with language production. Now,
because infants can understand language before they can produce it, this
suggests that the Wernicke's area may develop earlier than the Broca's area.
