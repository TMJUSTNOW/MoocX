So the essence of Chomsky's view on language, is that the human mind learns
language naturally and easily. In fact, actually, learning is not even the best
word. We discover language, much the same way we discover walking. It just
happens to us. In fact, think about how easy it was for you learning your first
native language. You didn't really learn it, it just happened. So, it's not at
all like math or reading or history, you just do it. This is Chomsky's view on
language acquisition.
