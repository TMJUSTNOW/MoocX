So I'm going to discuss B.F Skinner's theory of Verbal Behavior and how we
acquire language. And you'll see that adults do much to encourage imitation
from children. And one way they do so is through what's called child directed
speech. You saw an example of child directed speech in the lesson on
development when we had the quiz. I was engaging in child-directed speech, and
I did so by raising my voice a higher pitch, I talked in smaller sentences, and
I used lots of emotion. Oh, aren't you a cute little baby?
