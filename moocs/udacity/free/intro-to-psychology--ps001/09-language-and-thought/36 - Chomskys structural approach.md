You know, yes, Chomsky did look at the structure of language and he did
believed that there was a universal structure to language. And that humans have
this inborn natural capacity to acquire language. In fact, he called it a
language acquisition device that we're born with. So in fact, specific
languages, all 6,000 of the world's languages. Are just expressions of this
universal grammar, and so in this sense Chomsky was a nativist. He argued very
much that we don't so much learn language as we discover it. It's natural,
universal grammar.
