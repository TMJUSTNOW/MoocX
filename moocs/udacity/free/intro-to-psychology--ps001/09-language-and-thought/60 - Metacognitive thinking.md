The last term in this section that we're going to talk about is the idea of
metacognitive thinking. In metacognitive thinking, is the process that includes
the ability to first think and then to reflect on one's own thinking. So it's
thinking about thinking. So if you ponder how to solve a particular problem,
and you first think about the solution and then you think about the process to
get to that solution, that's metacognitive thinking. Now this ability is not
universal. Without specific training, many people have difficulty questioning
their own thinking.
