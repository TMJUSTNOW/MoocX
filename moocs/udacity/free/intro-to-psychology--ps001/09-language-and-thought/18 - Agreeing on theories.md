There're theories in psychology that psychologists don't necessarily agree on.
And one of them is language acquisition. But, lucky for you, we have two very
skilled PhD level psychologists, Greg and Susan, here to discuss their
different views. And this will allow you to make an education decision about
the strengths and weaknesses of each theory. As well as what each theory helps
us to accomplish. So I'm going to step out for a little while, and let Greg and
Susan take over the lesson. I'll see you guys a little later. Have fun thinking
like true psychologists.
