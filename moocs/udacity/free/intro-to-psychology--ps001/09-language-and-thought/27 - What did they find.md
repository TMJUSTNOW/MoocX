Now what do you think the study found? Do you think there was a positive
correlation? Meaning as socioeconomic status increased, verbal ability also
increased. Or, was there a negative correlation? As socioeconomic status
decreased, verbal ability increased or was there no corelation between
socioeconomic status and verbability. So take a moment and think about it and
choose one response. It's okay if you don't know, just take a guess.
