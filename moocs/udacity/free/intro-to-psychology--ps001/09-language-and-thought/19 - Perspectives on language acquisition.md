So, Lauren's right. You know, sometimes different psychologists do have
different perspectives on things. But you may we wondering, what's so important
about theory? Who really cares?
>> Well, actually, it's quite interesting. Psychologists who have different
perspectives on language acquisition have actually had some heated debates in
the past. For example, I was trained as a behaviorist. So I subscribe more to
B.F. Skinner's theory of verbal behavior.
>> And I side more with Noam Chomsky. The point is that Chomsky and Skinner did
disagree, have different perspectives on how language was acquired, but that's
okay.
