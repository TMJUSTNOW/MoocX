So what is language? Well, words are just arbitrary sounds put together. Which
is clear when you listen to languages that you don't know. However, when it's a
language that you do know, these sounds have deep and immediate meaning.
Language expresses ideas, thoughts, and intentions. Language and thought go
really well together. However, they're not the exact same thing. We can express
thoughts without language sometimes. For example, if we use things like
imagery, art, music, or even dance.
