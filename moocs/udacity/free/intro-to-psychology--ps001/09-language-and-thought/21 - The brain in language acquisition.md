See, as Susan is right, but to me language learning is as much about the brain,
as it is about imitation and reward reinforcement. So for instance, humans
after all learned thousands and thousands of rules of grammar without ever
knowing they even have learned them. So reward and reinforcement can't be the
only explanation. Now of course, we also need input from culture and the
environment to learn languages. After all, we learn specific languages. So in
that way, Susan and I agree. Learning language is more nature and nurture than
it is nature or nurture.
