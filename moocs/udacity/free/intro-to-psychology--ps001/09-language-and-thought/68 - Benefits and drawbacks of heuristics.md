What heuristics tell us about human
thought and decision making is that
they're quick and efficient, and therefore
they're adaptive in everyday life.
They allow us to make decisions
such as whether or not we should
jump out of the way of that
moving car to save our lives.
However, heuristics can also lead
to biased decision and estimate making,
and unfortunately we see
that humans are not as rational
as we would like to think we are.
