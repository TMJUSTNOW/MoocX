If you have had a dream in a language different than the one you usually speak,
this will be a great opportunity to discuss it on the forums, and some people
have been known to dream in a different language. I had a student in one of my
classes, who was a native Spanish speaker, and learned how to speak English for
school, but he told me, every once in a while, even though he spoke English
almost all the time, he would have a dream in Spanish. Go to the forums and
share your experiences.
