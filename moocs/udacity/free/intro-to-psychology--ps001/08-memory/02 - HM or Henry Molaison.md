For 50 years, the identity of HM was hidden. However, after his passing, and
agreed by his family, his name was revealed, and he was Henry Molaison. Now
Henry started experiencing epileptic seizures when he was a child, and in fact
these grew in both duration and frequency. In fact they were debilitating. He
could lose consciousness and have a seizure weekly, and sometime have minor
attacks up to ten times a day. Now as you can imagine, these seizures greatly
interfered with his daily living. So much so that he wasn't able to get his
high school diploma until age 21. By then, unfortunately, the seizures were so
bad it was difficult for him to even hold down a job.
