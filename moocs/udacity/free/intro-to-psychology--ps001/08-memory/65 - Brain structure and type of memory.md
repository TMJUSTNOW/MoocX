Now I want you to try this, match the following brain structures to the type of
memory. Again, we have the cerebellum, striatum, amygdala, and hippocampus. And
here are the type of memories, so one type of memory would be your first
heartbreak. What part of the brain would be involved in this type of memory. If
I asked you what happened during World War II what part of your brain would you
use to recall this information? If you had to remember how to ride a bike, what
part of the brain would you use? Type the corresponding letter to the type of
memory that this brain structure is involved in.
