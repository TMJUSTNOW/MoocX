Now take a few minutes and try to come up with a mnemonic device for our
grocery list. Type your mnemonic device here. And I also want you to share it
on the forums with your peers and see who comes up with the most creative or
the best one. You can rearrange the letters if you'd like, they don't have to
be in this order. There's no right or wrong answers here, but you're going to
want to remember this.
