Thank you for that Greg. Now you've most likely heard of another type of memory
loss. Which is a result of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a
devastating disease. Again for both people with Alzheimer's and their loved
ones. Alzheimer's can effect people over the age of 60. It's a very rare to
have an early onset Alzheimer's disease. And Alzheimer's disease results in
progressive memory loss, and eventually complete memory loss.
