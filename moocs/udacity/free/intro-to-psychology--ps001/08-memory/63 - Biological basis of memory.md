So far in this lesson, we've talked about different types of memory as well as
different ways of forgetting and memory loss. But, in this next section, we're
going to switch gears and we're going to talk about the role the brain plays in
remembering and forgetting. So, the biological basis of memory. We know that
our long-term memory start with our sensations. And those are processed and
output with our cortical sensory association areas, such as our visual
association or auditory association areas, and that different brain regions are
involved in different types of memory systems.
