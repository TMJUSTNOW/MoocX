Well, were able to remember directions because of our short term or sometimes
called our working memory. Working memory allows for the day-to-day fluidity of
our actions. So this includes things like listening to someone speak, and
remembering what they're saying during the conversation. Same thing with
reading and remembering what you're reading. Now, working memory can be
transfered into long-term memory, but only if we practice. Otherwise these
memories are lost. For example, in the case of a phone number, you may have to
repeat it over and over again in your head until you dial the number, or you
may forget it.
