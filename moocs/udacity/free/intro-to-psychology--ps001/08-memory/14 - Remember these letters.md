Now, in the previous example where I had you remember numbers, it was no
coincidence that I chose seven digits. I chose seven digits because of a
process called Chunking. It's much easier to remember things in chunks than it
is in individual units. Here I want you to try this. Remember these letters, D,
C, V, N, U, D, A, I. Now, count by threes to 30, 3, 6, 9, 12, and so on. Now
what were the letters I said? Write them here.
