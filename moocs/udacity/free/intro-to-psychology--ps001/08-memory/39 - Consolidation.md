Now we were discussing encoding, which is the first step in our ability to move
information from our short term to our long term memory. Now the second stage
in long term memory formation is consolidation. And consolidation is the
process of establishing, stabilizing or solidifying a memory. If you'll recall
from our lesson on consciousness, you'll remember that sleep is essential for
our ability to consolidate our memories. In fact, sleep deprivation can
negatively affect our ability to remember. So as we stressed in the
consciousness lesson, it's important that we get the required amount of sleep,
so that we can consolidate our memories.
