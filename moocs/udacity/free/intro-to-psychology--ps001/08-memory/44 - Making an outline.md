So, let's say for example when your studying for this lesson you make an
outline using headings that are similar to chapters in a book. So first would
be memory, and probably types of memory like short term and long term. And then
underneath each of these you'd get more specific. And then you would add things
on this list that we're going to cover later in the lesson. The biological side
of memory or forgetting. And under each sub category you get more and more
specific. This is an example of what? An associative network? A schema? A
hierarchy? Or a mnemonic device? Select one.
