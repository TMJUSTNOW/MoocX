Now, remember from the sense Olympics, we discussed the basic process involved
in sensation and perception. And we see that our sensory memory system is quite
clear cut. Remember that our sensory neurons take information from external
stimuli and our sensory organs to different parts of the brain. Recall that
sensation travels to the thalamus, which then relays a sensor information to
the cerebral cortex where it gets further processed. Three out of our five
sensory systems have a specific cortex for processing sensory stimuli.
