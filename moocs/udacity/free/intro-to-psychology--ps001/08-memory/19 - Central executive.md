Thanks Lauren. As we cans see, we are constantly being bombarded with stimuli
throughout our day. Let's look at a typical mundane example of getting on a
train and going up to campus. All the different sights, sounds, smells and even
tactile stimuli. Thousands and thousands of sensations. How do we know what to
pay attention to? In Bentley's model, he says we have what's called a central
executive. And a central executive helps us to focus on a particular stimulus,
and different aspects of that stimulus. So the central executive allows us to
pay attention. Now there are three storage systems that aid in this process.
And we're going to head back to Lauren to see what those are.
