The number was 3, 9, 2, 7, 1, 5, 4. So when I asked you to remember the
numbers, you probably began rehearsing them in your head. But was it harder to
remember the number correctly when I started saying other numbers? Often times
that little distracter, just hearing the other numbers, will interfere with
your rehearsal of this number. So in order for the mateiral being this number
to be retained, we need to somehow get the information into our long term
memory.
