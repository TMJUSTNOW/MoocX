Now let's recap a bit. First we talked about encoding, which talked about
automatic processing and effortful processing. And we also talked about levels
of processing. And here, we discussed structural, phonetic, and semantic levels
of processing. We also talked about common ways to encode information deeply
using a mnemonic device. Next we talk about consolidation, where we know that
sleep is important. Then we moved on to storage and talked about three ways
that we can store information. Using hierarchies, schemas, and associative
network. Now finally we have retrieval, which is simply recovery of information
stored in memory.
