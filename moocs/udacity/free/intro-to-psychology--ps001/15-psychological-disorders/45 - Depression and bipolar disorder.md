Another psychological disorder that involves depression is bipolar disorder.
Symptoms of bipolar disorder are very severe. These are very different than the
normal ups and downs of everyday life. People with bipolar disorder experience
severe fluctuation from extreme lows, which is the major depression end of
things, to extreme highs, which are the manic stages.
