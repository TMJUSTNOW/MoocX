Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is a disorder that manifests in both thought and
behavior. An obsession is an unwanted thought, phrase, word or image that
persistently and repeatedly comes into a person's mind, and causes distress. A
compulsion is a repetitive behavior performed in response to uncontrollable
urges or to a ritualistic set of rules. Interestingly people with OCD are aware
that their thoughts are irrational and that their compulsive behaviors are also
irrational and unnecessary. But they simply cannot stop themselves. What are
