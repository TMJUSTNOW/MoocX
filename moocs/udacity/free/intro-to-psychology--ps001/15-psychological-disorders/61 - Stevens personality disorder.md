Let's try it again. Match the example with the personality disorder. Steven
believes that a government agency has bugged his phone because they're after
his doll collection. He also thinks his colleagues are after it too. However,
his co-workers don't even know he has a doll collection. It has gotten to the
point where he doesn't leave his house or use his phone because he thinks
people want to steal his dolls. Steve has what type of personality disorder?
