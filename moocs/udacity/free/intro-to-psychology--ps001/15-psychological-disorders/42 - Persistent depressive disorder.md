In addition to major depressive disorder, there are other depressive disorders
that have milder symptoms, but the key is that they last longer. One of these
milder forms include persistent depressive disorder, or PDD. Most of the
symptoms of PDD are the same as in major depressive disorder, but they are less
intense in PDD. Also the depressive mood lasts for most of the day and most of
the time for at least two years. Remember, in major depressive disorder you
only need to have the symptoms for two weeks. In addition, people with PDD may
also experience one or more episodes of major depressive disorder during their
lifetime.
