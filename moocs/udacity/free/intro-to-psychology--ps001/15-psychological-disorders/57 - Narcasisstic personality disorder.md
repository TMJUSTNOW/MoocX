So people diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, are characterized
by an overly inflated sense of self, a very positive view of themselves. All
their attention is self focused. Like the world kind of revolves around them.
and because of this they really do disregard the needs of other people, and
make really strong demands on other people. Now, they appear to be very
confident but this confidence is very fragile and vulnerable. They get really,
really upset when other people criticize them. And, in fact, also the
relationships, having a relationship with someone with this disorder is very,
very difficult and trying because it's all about them.
