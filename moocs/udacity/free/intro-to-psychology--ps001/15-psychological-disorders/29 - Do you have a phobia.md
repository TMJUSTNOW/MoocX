Phobias. Do you have a specific phobia. There are numerous other phobias that
people experience. For example, people have phobias of spiders, heights, bees,
snakes, flying and being in closed spaces to name a few. So do you remember
Lauren's response to Tickles. Now Lauren doesn't have a full blown snake
phobia, but maybe a mild one. So what about you?
