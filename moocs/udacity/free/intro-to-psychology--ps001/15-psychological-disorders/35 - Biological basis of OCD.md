There appears to be a moderate genetic heritability for OCD, as seen from twin

studies, but researchers are still examining the biological basis of OCD. One

hypothesis has suggested heightened neural activity in the caudate nucleus. And

the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC, of the brain. Some research findings

suggest that those with OCD have an overactive loop between the thought that

something is wrong, which the obsession, and wanting to do something about it

to make it stop, which is the compulsion. The obsession involves the ACC,

whereas the compulsion involves the caudate nucleus. This cycle goes on and on

and gets stuck leading to obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. Now

let's go back to Lauren and talk about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
