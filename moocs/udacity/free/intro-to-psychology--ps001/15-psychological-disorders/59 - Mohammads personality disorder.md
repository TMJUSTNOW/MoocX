Match this example with the type of personality disorder. Mohammad likes to be
alone and doesn't enjoy being with others or activities with others. He goes to
work and then goes right home without really interacting with any of his
colleagues. He doesn't really care what other people think of him, they could
congratulate him or reprimand him, but neither would really affect him. Check
which one you think applies.
