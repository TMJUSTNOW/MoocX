Next, Greg, Susan and I are going to talk about dramatic emotional personality
disorders. These include histrionic, borderline, anti-social, and narcissistic
personality disorders. So to start, people with histrionic personality disorder
act in very dramatic, seductive, flamboyant and exaggerated ways. They can also
be very emotional, intense, self-centered and shallow. So as you can imagine it
can be very difficult to have a relationship with somebody with histrionic
personality disorder because of how self-centered and shallow they really are.
