However, just having one or even two of these four D's doesn't typically mean
it's classified as a disorder. Moreover, if a behavior is culturally accepted,
it cannot be a disorder. For example, in some indigenous cultures Shamen ingest
hallucinogenic mushrooms in order to experience hallucinations. That's
acceptable in that culture and therefore wouldn't be considered a disorder.
