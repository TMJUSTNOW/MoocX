The two main brain regions involved in schizophrenia are the prefrontal cortex
and the hippocampus. If you remember, the prefrontal cortex is involved in
working memory, paying attention and staying focused and organizing our
thoughts. People suffering from schizophrenia have disfunction in this region
of the brain. Secondly, people with schizophrenia often have smaller
hippocampi, which affects learning and memory and can lead to some of the
disorganized thinking seen in schizophrenia.
