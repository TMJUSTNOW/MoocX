Caesar is a very intense manager. He forces his employees to meet the demands
that are nearly impossible. For example, he forced Jonathan to work on the day
after he had a major surgery on his leg. Anyone who knows Caesar knows he's
incredibly confident. Too confident, in fact. Even though he is so confident if
he receives the smallest criticism he is extremely sensitive to it. What kind
of personality disorder does Ceaser have?
