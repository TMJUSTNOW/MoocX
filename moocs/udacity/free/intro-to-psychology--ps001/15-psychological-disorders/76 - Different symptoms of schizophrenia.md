However, it is important to note that the symptoms of schizophrenia differ
person by person. And that includes the combination of symptoms they
experience, as well as the severity of the symptoms and their duration. That
said, sometimes schizophrenia is a chronic condition and the person is
constantly experiencing hallucinations and delusions. However, other times
people experience periods where they are somewhat symptom free, but
occasionally have periods of a more acute form of psychosis. Therefore, each
individual is different and will experience the symptoms of the disorder in
different ways.
