Now that we know more about the big five, how do we measure personality? Long
interviews about the person's life. Ratings gathered from family and friends.
Ratings gathered from people themselves, so a person rating them self.
Discussions during psychotherapy sessions. Stories from inkblots and drawings.
Facebook likes. Astrology charts. Or palm reading. Check all that apply.
