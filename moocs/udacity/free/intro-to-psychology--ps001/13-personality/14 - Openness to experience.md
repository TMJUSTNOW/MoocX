So openness to experience is the tendency to prefer to explore, be curious
about our world and to be open and prefer new experiences, for instance foods,
people, places and kinds of music. It's also connected to being curious,
creative and imaginative. On the other end of the spectrum, low openness to
experience, we have a preference for the tried and true to the unknown. A
preference for the familiar to the unfamiliar. And a preference for the
realistic to the imaginative.
