We have no problem knowing that humans have personality. That they consistently
act and think in unique ways that distinguish them from other people. But what
about animals? Do cats, dogs or horses have personality? What about pigs or
fish or octopi do they? Well mounting scientific evidence suggests that many
species of mammals, birds, fish and even some invertebrates have unique traits
of personality.
