So let's try another one. If environment played little to no role and genetics
played a large role in personality formation, what pattern of results do you
think we would see? We'd see similar personality styles between close relatives
regardless of where they grew up. We'd see similarity in personality between
only close relatives who were raised together. We'd seem similarity in
personality between all relatives only if they were raised together. Or
finally, we'd see similarity in personality would increase as genetic closeness
increased.
