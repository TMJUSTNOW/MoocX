So to give you an example of the biological basis of introversion and
extraversion. Researchers measured the level of introversion and extraversion
and then simply shined a light of the same intensity into everyone's eye, one
at a time. As you know, pupils constrict when being exposed to a sudden
increase in light. So they get smaller. So based on Eysenck's theory of the
biological basis of introversion and extraversion. Whose pupil do you think
will constrict or respond most to the light? Do you think introverts' eyes will
constrict the most or extraverts'? Chose one.
