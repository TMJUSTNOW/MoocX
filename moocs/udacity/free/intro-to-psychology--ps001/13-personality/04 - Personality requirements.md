Personality requires that we know three things about a person. First, is how
different is the behavior compared to others. That is, how unique is the
behavior. Second, is does the personality trait exist in many different
situations. And finally, does the personality trait exist regularly over time?
Until we can answer all three of these questions, we can't say much about a
persons personality.
