And finally, the most commonly used assessment of personality is giving people
questionnaires that have a bunch of statements that people have to agree with
or disagree with to some degree. Questionnaires cover a wide range of
personality traits. And different statements might read something like, I enjoy
going to parties. Or, I feel sad and lonely much of the time. This technique is
popular among researchers, who want to asses personality traits in hundreds,
even thousands of people.
