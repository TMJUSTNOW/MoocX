In addition to the genetic and environmental evidence for personality, there's
also evidence for a biological basis for personality. The psychologist Hans
Eysenck developed a biological theory of introversion and extroversion as well
as neuroticism. He proposed that differences in people's nervous systems lead
to different personality. This is most easily seen in the introversion and
extroversion dimension of personality. Eysenck argued that two qualities of the
central nervous system led to introversion and extroversion. The first is
arousal levels of the cortex. And the second is threshold for sensory
stimulation. Let's look at these a little more closely.
