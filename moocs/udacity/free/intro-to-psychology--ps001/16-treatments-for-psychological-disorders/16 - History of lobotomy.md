The lobotomy has a tragic and torrid history, in that, in nearly four decades
approximately 40,000 lobotomies were performed. If you're interested in the
history of the lobotomy there's a lot of information available on the web. In
addition, you may be interested in a book about Walter Freeman. Who's
considered one of the most scored physicians because he performed approximately
Lobotomy" by Howard Dully. In that book, Mr Dully explains his experience of
getting a prefrontal lobotomy from Walter Freeman. Now, we're going to post a
link from a PBS special in the instructor's note box. I want to warn you that
this video is extremely graphic because it shows actual lobotomies being
performed. Therefore, I want to warn you that it can be very upsetting,
disturbing, or disconcerting to watch. So please think carefully before you do
so.
