Now we asked you to read material in the instructors' note section on the
different types of drugs that are used to treat the different types of
disorders. Now that you've done that, let me ask you this question. If someone
had a panic disorder that was comorbid with major depressive disorder, which of
the following would most likely be prescribed? Do you think it would be a
neuroleptic or antipsychotic such as chloropromazine, a selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor such as Prozac, Lithium which is an element that we
discussed, or a stimulant such as the d-amphetamine? Think about it for a
moment and choose one.
