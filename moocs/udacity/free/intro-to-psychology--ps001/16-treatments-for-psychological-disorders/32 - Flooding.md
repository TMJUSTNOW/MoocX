Another behavioral technique that involves exposing a person to the feared
stimulus is flooding. Flooding is based on the response prevention principle.
Flooding involves prolonged exposure to the feared stimulus, which in turn
provides maximum opportunity for the fear to be extinguished. Now, unlike
systematic desensitization, which slowly exposes a person to a stimulus,
flooding does it all at once. Now, at times, flooding can actually make a
phobia worse and it has to be used carefully. For example, with people with
medical conditions. And you can't use it with all types of phobias. For
example, house fires.
