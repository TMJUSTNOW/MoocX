Another interesting and effective behavioral technique is aversion therapy.
Aversion therapy works by reducing the attractiveness of a stimulus by pairing
it with an adversive stimulus. For example, it can be used with alcohol. By
pairing alcohol with an aversive stimulus such as nausea. Same can be said with
rapid smoking, which induces nausea, and therefore makes a person feel aversive
towards cigarette smoking. It's also been used with pedophelia, where they pair
inappropriate sexual stimuli with an inversive response, such as nausea
