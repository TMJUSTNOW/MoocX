Now let's move on to another form of psychotherapy. But first, let me ask you a
question. Let's say you're a therapist and you had a client with very little
self esteem. Who wouldn't apply for any jobs because they didn't think they
were good enough. And wouldn't go out on any dates because they didn't think
anyone would ever like them because they're just a worthless individual. How
would you treat your patient? Write your response here. Don't worry, I'm not
looking for exact wording or anything like that. Just let me know how you'd
handle this situation.
