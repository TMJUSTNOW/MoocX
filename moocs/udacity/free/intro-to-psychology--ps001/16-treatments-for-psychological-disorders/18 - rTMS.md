In addition to ECT, repetitive, transcranial, magnetic stimulation is another
form of treatment for treating severe depression. And this involves exposing
specific parts of the brain to bursts of high-intensity magnetic fields as
opposed to electricity. Again, this treatment is only used as a last resort
when a person did not respond positively to other forms of treatment. Some of
the side effects can include a mild headache or brief light-headedness. In
addition, the person's scalp, face, and jaw may contract and tingle during the
procedure.
