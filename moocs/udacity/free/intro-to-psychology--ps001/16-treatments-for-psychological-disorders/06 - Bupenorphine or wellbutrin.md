Another drug used to treat depression is Buprenorphine or Wellbutrin. And this
is chemically unrelated to the tricyclics, the MAOIs, and the SSRIs. It
inhibits the uptake of norepinephrine and dopemine which are associated with
the arousal and positive mood. In addition, the drug is also marketed under the
name Zyban and it serves as a smoking cessation aid.
