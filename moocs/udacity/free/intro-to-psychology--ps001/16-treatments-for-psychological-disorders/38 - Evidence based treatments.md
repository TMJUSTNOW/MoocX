cognitive therapy seem to be the most effective tools in treating a variety of
disorders. For example, some research suggests that cognitive therapy is as
effective as anti-depressants in treating depression. In addition, behavioral
therapy is very effective in treating a wide variety of disorder. However, we
do stress that if you or a loved one has a psychological disorder that you seek
a health care professional in determining the best treatment option for you.
