As you can see that combining the behavioral approach, which changes
maladaptive behaviors, with the cognitive approach, which changes maladaptive
thoughts, can create a very successful treatment option. Cognitive behavioral
therapy, or "CBT" combines restructuring of irrational thoughts with operate
and classical conditioning techniques to reshape desirable behaviours.
Together, this has revolutionized the treatment of many psychological
disorders.
