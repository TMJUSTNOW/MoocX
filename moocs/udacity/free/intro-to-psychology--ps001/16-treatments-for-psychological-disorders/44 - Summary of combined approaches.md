So to summarize our discussion of combined therapies, it's sometimes very
useful to use the strengths of different techniques at the same time to best
help treat various psychological disorders. Specifically, some of the most
effective and popular combined therapies involve using psychotherapy with drug
therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy with mindfulness mediation techniques.
So because no one therapy typically can treat all aspects of a disorder,
integrative therapies can sometimes be more effective than either one alone.
