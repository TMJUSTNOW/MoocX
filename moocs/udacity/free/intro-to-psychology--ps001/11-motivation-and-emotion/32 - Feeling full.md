So think about these special occasions you really like to celebrate. New Years
Eve, your birthday or just going to a nice restaurant with your friends. So
your food comes along, you know, maybe turkey, mashed potatoes, gravey. You eat
it up, it's very good and you get full. Okay then dessert comes along. You know
apple pie, pecan pie, ice cream, whatever. And all of a sudden you have room
for that, so what's going on is your brain has, sends different signals, for
savory like the turkey and sweet like the pecan pie. So you maybe full for the
savory stuff but you still have room for that sweet pecan pie.
