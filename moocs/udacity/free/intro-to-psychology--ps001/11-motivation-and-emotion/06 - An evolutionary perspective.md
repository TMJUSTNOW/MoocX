So, from an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense that our bodies have these
internal mechanisms that propel us to act in ways necessary for survival and
reproduction. Let's take hunger and thirst, for example. So these needs propel
us to act in ways toward, to look for food and water. And if we're successful,
we survive, we reproduce, we pass on our genes. Now we also have a need to
reproduce. Now as individuals we don't actually need to reproduce in order to
survive. Although, of course, as a species we do. it's a little more
complicated, so we'll talk more about sex and reproduction later on in the
lesson.
