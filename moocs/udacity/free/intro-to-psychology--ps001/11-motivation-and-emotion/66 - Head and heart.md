People sometimes talk about the head and heart, that is, cognition and emotion,
as being two different things. Some people are rational and some people are
emotional. Now, although there might be some value in separating thought and
emotion, we find that emotions can be very helpful for us, and adaptive. They
can be helpful when we need to solve problems, and they can help us adapt to an
environment.
