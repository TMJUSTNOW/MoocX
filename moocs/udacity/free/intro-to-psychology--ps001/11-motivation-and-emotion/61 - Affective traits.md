And last but not least, we have affective traits. These are enduring parts of
our personality that permanently affect how likely we are to experience
particular emotions. Some people are hostile, for example, and they experience
anger and aggression more easily than less hostile people. Other people have
anxious personalities, and they experience fear and anxiety more easily than
most people.
