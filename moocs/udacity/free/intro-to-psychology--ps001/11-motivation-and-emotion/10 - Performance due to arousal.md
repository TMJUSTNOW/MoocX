So this happened to me in my last year of graduate school, when I was trying to
give a neuroscience presentation on an article I read. I knew the article
really well, but I hadn't slept at all the night before the presentation, I was
really stressed out with work and school, so I just wasn't thinking straight.
And I get up there, I'm halfway through, then I just completely blank. I have
no idea what I'm talking about, I have to consult my notes. It was kind of
embarrassing, but I got through it. Luckily my classmates were pretty nice
about it, so don't feel alone if this has happened to you.
