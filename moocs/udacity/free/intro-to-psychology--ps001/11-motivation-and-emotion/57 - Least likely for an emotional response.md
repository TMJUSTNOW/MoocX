Should be obvious, that this first one, is the least likely to create an
emotional response. Why? Because it's the only one that doesn't touch on
something important to a person. We only experience emotion, when our personal
goals and values are involved. Moods do sometime effect emotion, making certain
emotions more likely than others. For instance, when you're in a good mood, you
experience happiness or giddiness more easily, and anger and sadness less
easily.
