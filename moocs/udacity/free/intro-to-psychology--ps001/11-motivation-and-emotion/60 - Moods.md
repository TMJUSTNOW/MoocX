So as I said moods are longer lasting affective experiences and usually are not
in response to very specific situations. Moods can last minutes or hours and
occasionally even longer and as for the cause of moods, as compared to emotion,
the cause is vague and not clear. We often just find ourselves in a good mood
or in a bad mood and we don't really know why.
