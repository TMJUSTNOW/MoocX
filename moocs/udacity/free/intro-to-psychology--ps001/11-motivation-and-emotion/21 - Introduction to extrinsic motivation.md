Now, extrinsic motivation is motivation that comes from outside of the person.

pioneered the study of operant conditioning. And industrial organizational
psychologists have used the principles of operant conditioning very
effectively. We find that extrinsic rewards can increase productivity,
accuracy, and even quality.
