There's a number of things you can do, from simply congratulating your
employees on doing a job, to thanking them for their hard work and devotion.
Now, think about it. Have you ever had a job where you felt like your employer
didn't value you or your contributions to the organization? Well, allot of us
have and unfortunately you feel less valued and your less likely to be
productive and engaged. On the other hand if you've had a job where you felt
like your employer really did value you and your overall level of satisfaction,
you're more likely to be a better employee, happy, more productive and more
invested in the organization.
