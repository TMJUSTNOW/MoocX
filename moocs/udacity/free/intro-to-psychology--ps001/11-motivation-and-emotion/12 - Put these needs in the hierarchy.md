I want you to do your best to order these types of needs into the hierarchy of
needs. Now the answer won't always be clear, but it might be fun to discuss
your reasoning on the forum with your peers. This will make for a great forum
topic. We have water, having a satisfying and fulfilling career,
self-confidence, earning a paycheck, and a happy and secure relationship.
Determine where you think the needs will go on the hierarchy, and then place
the letter in the corresponding box.
