So the moral of the story is to keep smiling, always try to smile, it might
actually make you happier and really benefit your well being. This is the only
time I am going to ever assign homework, smile ten minutes a day and make an
effort to smile, there is no due date or grade on this, you get to grade
yourself. I just want you guys to be happy. And I think this is the way that
can help you be happy. Now, let's go back to Greg for another way to express
emotion.
