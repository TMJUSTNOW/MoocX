powerful and universal. Indeed, as we've said throughout the course, humans are
social creatures and we need interaction. Perhaps remember the lesson on
development with Terry Harlow and his research with the baby monkeys. Those
monkeys needed contact comfort, and they chose among them the most resemble
their own over the

others in order to thrive, and this need for social contact and belongingness
is called the need for affiliation.
