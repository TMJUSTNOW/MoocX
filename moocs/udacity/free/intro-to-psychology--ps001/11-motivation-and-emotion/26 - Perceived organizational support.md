The last area we're going to talk about in motivation in the workplace is
perceived organizational support. Perceived organizational support is an
employees belief that their organization appreciates them and supports them in
their contributions and their well being. Employees that feel that their
employer actually cares about them and supports them feel less stressed and
enjoy their jobs more. Than those, who feel that their employer doesn't care
about them.
