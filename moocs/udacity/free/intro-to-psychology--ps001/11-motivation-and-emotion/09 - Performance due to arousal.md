Have you ever experienced a time that you think that you under performed or
optimally performed because of your arousal level. For example, have you ever
given a speech that you knew by heart, but when you were on stage, and you were
really nervous and all the caffeine you drank, made you really shaky, so you
messed up. Something like that ever happen to you? Try to think of something.
I'm sure there's been a time that you either did really well, or not so well
because, I don't know, you didn't get enough sleep, or you were too anxious,
things like that, and write it here. And this could also be a really good time
for you to discuss this with your peers on the forums.
