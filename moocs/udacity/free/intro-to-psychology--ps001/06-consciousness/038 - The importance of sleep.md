The importance of sleep is often overlooked. A lot of us think that we can get
by on minimal sleep. However, we know that there are serious negative effects
to our mental and physical health, as well as our overall quality of life, and
our safety. For example the National Center for Sleep Disorder Research noted
that thousands of car accidents are caused by drowsy driving. They also note
that losing one to two hours of sleep per night can result in depression. Now,
these are important things that we need to consider the next time one of us
wants to pull an all nighter, right?
