Thanks, Susan. So, tolerance means that more of a drug is needed to produce the
original effects. So, for example, a person might take meth, and on subsequent
occasions have to take a higher dose to produce the same feelings they did the
first time they used it. This is also true for alcohol. One glass of wine after
repeated use will not produce the same effects, so a person has to drink more.
Tolerance is the body's way of trying to adjust to the constant presence of the
drug.
