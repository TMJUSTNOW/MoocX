Now, where would you place tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon on this chart? Would it
go here? Not very awake and not very aware. Would it go here? Really aware but
you're not awake. Would it go here where you're not aware but you are awake? Or
would it go here where you're awake, but not completely aware? Select one that
you think is where the tip-of-the tongue phenomenon would be on this chart of
awareness and wakefulness. So, the more awake you are, you're over here and the
more aware you are, you're up here.
