There's some things that can promote regular sleep habits. But before I get
into them, I want you to look at the lists I'm about to show you. And tell me
what you think is good for sleep and what you think is bad for sleep. If you go
to bed at the same time each night, is that good for sleep or bad for sleep? If
you excercise right before bed, is that good for sleep or bad for sleep? If you
eat a big meal right before bed. Is that good for sleep or bad for sleep? If
you turn off your TV, computer, cell phone or any gadget before bed, is that
good for sleep or bad for sleep? Fill in the blank with either the word good or
bad.
