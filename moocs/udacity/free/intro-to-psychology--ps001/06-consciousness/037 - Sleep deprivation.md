So how do we know sleep is important? Well, based on experiments and case
studies in which people are sleep deprived, sleep deprivation can cause serious
consequences. Not only will you feel tired the next day, but your cognition can
also be affected. Lack of sleep can also interfere with school, work driving
ability, and social interactions. Sleep deficiency, an inadequate amount of
sleep, is linked to physical problems such as heart disease, stroke, high blood
pressure, diabetes. You know, this is really important, because the Center for
Disease Control found that between 7 to 19% of US adults report not getting an
adequate amount of sleep.
