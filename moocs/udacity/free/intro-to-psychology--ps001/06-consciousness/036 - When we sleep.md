When we sleep, our body works to restore itself after a long day of neural
activity. In fact, the brain can use up to 80% of its energy to sustain
synaptic activity. The brain needs a way to conserve energy after a long day of
wakefulness in physical an mental activity. Sleep also helps us in memory
consolidation, and learning. And finally, sleep is really important for neural
growth, as we've discussed before.
