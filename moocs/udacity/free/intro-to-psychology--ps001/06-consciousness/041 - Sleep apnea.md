The first sleep disorder we're going to talk about is Sleep Apnea. This is a
condition that results in a person having pauses in breathing while they're
sleeping, or shallow breathing. The pauses can last a few seconds or minutes.
This can happen up to 30 times or more an hour. In most cases, a person starts
breathing normally again, however this interruption in sleep causes the person
to go from deep sleep to light sleep. So this in turn results in a poor quality
of sleep. It makes the person tired the next day. This is one of the leading
causes of excessive daytime sleepiness.
