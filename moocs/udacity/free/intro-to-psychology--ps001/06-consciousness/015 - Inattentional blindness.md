So how could we not have noticed this gorilla walking through the group? Well,
we explain this through Selective Attention. The students were so focused on
paying attention to the ball passing that they weren't aware of the gorilla.
The technical term for this type of situation is Inattentional Blindness. This
happens when we're so engaged and paying attention to one thing, that we don't
notice something. Even if it's as unusual as something as a gorilla in a place
where it shouldn't be. Now, the take home message here is that, if we
selectively pay attention to one thing. Our ability to pay attention to other
things decreases. And we might not even be able to notice unusual stimuli.
