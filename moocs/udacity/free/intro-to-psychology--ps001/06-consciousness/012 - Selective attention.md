This was an example of selective attention which is our ability to pay
attention to our environment while ignoring certain aspects of our environment.
For example you may be watching TV, while a friend is talking to you. You can't
focus your attention equally on the two demands, your friend and the TV. So
you're not fully absorbing what's coming from either one.
