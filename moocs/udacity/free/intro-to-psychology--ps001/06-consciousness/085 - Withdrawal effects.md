So withdrawal effects are in the opposite direction of the effects that the  drug produces. Let's look at an example of heroin. So here, we will list the  effects that heroin produces. And we will see that when a person experiences  withdrawal, those effects are opposite. Let's start first with analgesia. So  heroin produces a variety of effects, we'll just look at four. One is  analgesia, this means it's a pain reliever. It will also produce pupil  constriction, meaning, people will have tiny pinpoint-like pupils. Also, it  produces euphoria. In fact, this is why people abuse heroin. And finally,  another effect is constipation. Now, a person who is physically dependent on  heroin and doesn't get the drug will now start to experience withdrawal  symptoms. And these are in the opposite direction, let's take a look. So the  withdrawal effects would be hyperalgesia, which is an increased sensitivity to  pain, pupil dilation, dysphoria,as well as diarrhea. In addition, people  undergoing withdrawal from heroin experience what they call a terrible flu-like  feeling. And these withdrawal symptoms can last for weeks. Therefore it is not  surprising when people go out to look for the drug to try to diminish those  withdrawal symptoms.
