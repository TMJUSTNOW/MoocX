Xavier and his brother Benjamin always feel sleepy during the day. Xavier
thinks he shouldn't feel so tire because he knows he sleeps during the night,
unlike his brother Benjamin who never falls asleep or stays asleep. Xavier
doesn't have trouble falling asleep but does, on occasion, feel that he comes
in and out of sleep throughout the night. Benjamin told Xavier that his
breathing sounded weird and inconsistent while he sleeps. What sleep disorders
do you think the brothers have? Xavier probably has what? And Benjamin probably
has what? Here are some options. Narcolepsy, sleep apnea, night terrors, and
insomnia.
