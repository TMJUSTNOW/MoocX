Did you notice that I changed my earrings, or that my hair was up and then it
was down, or that the color of the shirt I was wearing changed? This is what we
call change blindness. This refers to when not noticing when something changes.
A lot of magicians will use change blindness, or inattentional blindness to for
less during illusions
