Deep sleep, we go around here, because you're not very awake and you're not
very aware. However, coma, we go here, because you're not aware at all, nor are
you awake. Practicing the piano, we go up here, because you're very aware of
what's going on and you're also awake. Lucid dreaming would be here, because
you're not awake, but you are aware of what's going on. And finally vegetative
state would go here, because you might be completely awake, you're not aware of
what's going on.
