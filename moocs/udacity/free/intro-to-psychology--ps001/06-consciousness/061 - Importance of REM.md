So, why is REM sleep important? Well first, we can look for answers in sleep
patterns that occur across the lifetime. We see that REM sleep steadily
decreases from infancy to adulthood. For example, REM goes from about 50% of
total sleep time in infancy, to around 20% of total sleep time in childhood and
adulthood. However, then it increases slightly to around 23% of total sleep
time in old age. So for most of our life, we spend about 20 to 25% of sleep in
REM sleep. Now, if you remember from our previous lessons when we talked about
REM sleep, REM sleep is associated with neural growth.
