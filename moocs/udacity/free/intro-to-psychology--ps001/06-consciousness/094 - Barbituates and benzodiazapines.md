Barbiturates are not used as often today to treat anxiety  because they are not as safe as benzodiazepines. People are more likely to  overdose on barbiturates than benzodiazepines. Also, if barbiturates are  consumed with alcohol, it can cause death.

However, it's a widely abused drug that people use to self-medicate.  That is, they may use it to help them cope with problems in their life.  However, it is important to know that alcohol is a drug. You may hear people  say alcohol and drugs, when in fact it should be alcohol and other drugs.  You'll now be able to point that out to be people when you hear such a mistake,  because you know that alcohol is a drug.
