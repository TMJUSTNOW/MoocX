Lauren's right. Now, we're going to move on and talk about the Central Nervous  System Depressants or CNS Depressants. These include the Barbiturates, the  Benzodiazepines, and alcohol. The CNS Depressants slow activity in the Central  Nervous System, and the Benzodiazepines and Barbiturates are used medically to  treat anxiety, as well as insomnia. In general, the benzodiazepines and  barbituates produces effects that are similar to alcohol. In fact, these three  drug types are behavioral, motor, and cognitive inhibitors. A person may  respond to a low dose with feelings of relaxation or decreased anxiety.  
However, in some people that same dose can produce aggressive and even violent  behavior. In general, the CNS to presence can cause motor impairment, cognitive  impairment, slurred speech, disorientation, mental confusion and even amnesia.  
We're going to send it back to Lauren to talk about these three drug types.
