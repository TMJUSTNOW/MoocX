Alcohol is a teratogen, and you should remember that term from our lesson on
development. This means that if alcohol is in the system while the woman is
pregnant it can have serious consequences on the fetus. And one of those
consequences is called fetal alcohol syndrome. Now, fetal alcohol syndrome is a
collection of physical and behavioral abnormality. Some of the diagnostic
criteria for FAS include growth retardation both before and after birth as well
as abnormalities in the face and head. Now, its important to know that there is
no known safe level of alcohol consumption while pregnant.
