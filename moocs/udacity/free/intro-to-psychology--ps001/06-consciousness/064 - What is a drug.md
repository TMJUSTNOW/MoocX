As Susan said, it's important for us to start with, what is a drug? Here, I'm
going to show you a list of different things and I want you to check which of
them you think is considered a drug. If heroin or black tea, coffee,
antidepressants, some types of mushrooms, like those considered to be magic
mushrooms. Or pain killers, MDMA, nicotine, alcohol, LSD, aspirin, mescaline,
which is a hallucinogen, or marijuana, cocaine? Check as many or as few as you
would like.
