Hey. Hey you, are you listening? Are you paying attention to this lesson or are
you off daydreaming or surfing the Internet? Well, I personally hope you're
paying attention, because I'm about to tell you something really awesome about
consciousness, and a fundamental aspect of it. And that's attention. Attention
is our ability to focus on a specific aspect of our environment, and to be
conciously aware of this. Now, it's important to remember that this is a
conscious effort to focus our attention. Psychologists focus on two main types
of attention, that's Selective attention and Sustained attention.
