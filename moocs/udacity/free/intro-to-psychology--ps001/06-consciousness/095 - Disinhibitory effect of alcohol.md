Alcohol has what's known as a disinhibitory effect. This disinhibition means
that people are going to do things when they're drinking that they wouldn't
normally do. That's what we mean by risky behaviors when people are intoxicated
they'll do things they wouldn't do when they're sober. This could be why people
get into so much trouble when they've been drinking. People can't think
clearly, and they act inappropriately to their impulses. They also think in the
here-and-now, they don't necessarily think about the future or consequences
that can lead to a lot of trouble. But for now, let's switch gears and let's go
talk to Susan about the effect alcohol has on the body.
