So now, I want you to place the following activities in the appropriate boxes
on the consciousness chart. Deep sleep, coma, practicing the piano, lucid
dreaming, which means knowing that you are dreaming, and vegetative state.
Place the appropriate number in the appropriate box on this chart of awareness
and wakefulness. Remember, farther up means you're really aware, farther down
means you're not aware. Farther to the right means you're really awake, farther
to the left means you're not awake.
