It was great to hear Dr Griffiths and Dr Doblin discuss their exciting research  with psychedelics. It really is fascinating. Now, in this section of the  lesson, we discuss drugs of abuse and how they produce their psychoactive  effects. And though we discuss the general classes of drugs, there are many  specific drugs that we didn't get a chance to cover here. So now its times for  you to head over to the instructor notes section and read the additional  material that you'll need for this lesson. There we're going to discuss more  drugs, and we're also going to look at the evaluation process for drugs getting  approved by the FDA. And, finally, we'll finish up with some treatments for  drug dependents, so head on over to the instructor notes section.
