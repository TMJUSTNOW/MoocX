Before we talk about specific drugs and their physiological, behavioral and psychological effects. It's important to review some of the material that we learned in lesson three, the Biology of Behavior. 
First, remember that the central nervous system is comprised of the brain and the spinal cord. You should also review the autonomic nervous system as many drugs effect both of these nervous systems as well as their functioning. In addition, review the material on neurons, neurotransmission, neurotransmitters, and receptors. And then finally, be sure to look at the brain structures as well as the dopamine reward pathway.
