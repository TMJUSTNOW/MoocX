that there are many variables that can influence the risk of drug use and/or
drug abuse. 
These variables include stressful environments, impoverished
environments, co-existing mental health problems, hostile family environment.
Lack of alternative rewarding activities, drug using peers and particular
social environments such as parties or concerts. Sex, males are more likely to
use drugs than females, homelessness and culture. As you can see, this is quite
a list of potential variables that can pose a risk for drug use and abuse.
