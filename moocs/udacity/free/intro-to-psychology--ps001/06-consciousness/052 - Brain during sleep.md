So far, we've discussed the importance of sleep and the purpose of sleep. But
we still need to address a few of the questions we asked earlier in the lesson.
Namely, is the brain active during sleep and can we become consciously aware of
the fact that we are dreaming. There was a time when people thought that the
brain wasn't active or had very little activity while we sleep. However, we now
know that the brain is actually quite active. In fact, given the advancement in
technology, namely through EEG machines, we know that the brain goes through
what we call sleep stages.
