People can be different chronotypes, meaning they function best at different
times of the day. Have you heard the term night owl or morning person? Well,
these are different chronotypes. A night owl or an evening person is more
likely to rise later in the day and is more alert later in the day into the
evening. Whereas a morning person tends to wake up early. They're most
efficient in the morning and alert during the day. What chronotype are you? Are
you a morning person or an evening person?
