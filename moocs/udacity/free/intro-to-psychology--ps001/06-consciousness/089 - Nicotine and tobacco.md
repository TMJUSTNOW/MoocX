So far, we've concentrated on the major stimulants, but there is one minor  stimulant that is so addictive that it needs mention, and this is nicotine,  which is the active ingredient in tobacco. Nicotine is a colorless, highly  volatile alkaloid liquid. Nicotine activates central nervous system activity  and it stimulates the release of dopamine. Tobacco is the leading preventable  cause of death and disease in the United States and worldwide tobacco use  causes more than 5 million deaths per year.
