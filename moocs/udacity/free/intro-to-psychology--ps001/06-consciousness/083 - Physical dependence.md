Tolerance is an important concept that leads to two additional terms that are
key to understanding drug use and abuse. And those are physical and
psychological dependence. So, physical dependence is a different phenomenon
than tolerance, but they are often associated temporally. A person who is
physically dependent needs the drug in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
Moreover, these withdrawal symptoms can be both physically and psychologically
painful and challenging. Withdrawal from one particular drug can actually
result in death. Do you know which?
