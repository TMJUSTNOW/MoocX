Our sleep patterns are a result of Circadian rhythms which are biological
processes that occur over approximately a 24-hour cycle. For example throughout
a 24-hour period, our bodies will change in temperature. It'll peak a few hours
before we go to bed. And soon after we wake up, but it will decrease when we're
asleep. Production of certain chemicals, such as Melatonin. They will change
our alertness throughout the day. I mentioned Melatonin, this is produced in
the Pineal Gland, and it's important for sleep. It causes drowsiness and
lowering of the body temperature.
