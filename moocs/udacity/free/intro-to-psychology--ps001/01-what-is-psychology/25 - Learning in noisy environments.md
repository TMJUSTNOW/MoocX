Well, Susan, I would say
personality psychologist,
because we're looking
at introverts and extroverts.
And I know that personality psychologists
will look at the differences
between different personality
traits like those two.
And I would guess
cognitive psychologists too,
because I know they're interested in how
we learn and solve problems. Am I right?
That's right Lauren, good job.
