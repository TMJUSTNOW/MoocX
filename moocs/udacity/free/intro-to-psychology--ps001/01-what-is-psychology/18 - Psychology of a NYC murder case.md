Different psychologists will focus on different types of questions. For example, a famous case in New York City from the 1960s reported, that a woman was brutally attacked and ultimately murdered over a 30-minute period of time in an apartment complex. More than 30 people saw or heard this attack, yet only one person called the police. What type of psychologist do you think would explore why almost no one reacted to this crime while it was taking place? Select one.
