So, now that we've come to a close in this first lesson, we hope you can see
that psychology answers all of these questions and more. How deep, rich, and
broad psychology is as a discipline. In fact, it's as much about lab coats and
children, courtrooms, learning and memory. Our personalities and how other
people influences as much as it is about cultures and therapists. So, in the
coming lessons, we're going to focus in more detail on some of the kinds of
questions that psychologists ask and then attempt to answer. And, in doing so,
we hope to stimulate you to ask your own questions about human nature. Who
knows? Maybe one day you'll be providing us with answers as a psychologist.
