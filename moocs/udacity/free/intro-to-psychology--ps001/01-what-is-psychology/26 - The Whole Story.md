This gets us to an important point about psychology, and the fact that we have
many different sub-disciplines. As you can see from this example, not one
perspective of psychology tells the whole story. We may have to take
information from different perspectives to get an accurate and complete
description of the situation. Psychology helps us make sense of the world. By
using different levels of analysis and different perspectives, we can get a
better understanding of why behavior occurs, or in some cases, why it does not.
