It's important to know that the field
has two main areas.
There's the practice side,
and the research side.
The practice side focuses
on applying the knowledge
we gain from research in everyday life.
For example, diagnosing and treating
thought, and behavioral problems,
or helping businesses
operate more effectively.
Or even to get your children
to behave properly.
The research side focuses
on furthering our knowledge
and understanding of how
people behave and think.
