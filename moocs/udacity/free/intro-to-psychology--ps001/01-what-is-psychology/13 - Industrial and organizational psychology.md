Industrial and organizational psychology focuses on two distinct sets of
problems. The industrial side involves matching employees to their job and
using psychological principles to select employees and evaluate job
performance. The industrial side of IO psychology is sometimes referred to as
personnel psychology. The organizational side focuses on making workers more
productive. In addition, they examine how management styles and environment
influence motivation, satisfaction and productivity. IO psychology is one of
the fastest growing subdisciplines in psychology.
