The final factor of attraction is the psychological factor. Many of us know
that it's not just physical attractiveness or beauty that goes into finding the
perfect mate. There's something else that makes a person, well special. For
example what are their attitudes and beliefs? What's their personality like? Do
you agree with their points of view? Are they ambitious? These are inner
qualities that many people find very attractive. In fact, research shows that
we tend to marry people with similar socioeconomic status, ethnicities,
religious background, personalities, and level of education. So it seems that
similarities also play an important role in attraction.
