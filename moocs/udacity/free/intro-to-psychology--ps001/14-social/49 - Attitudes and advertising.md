Psychologists are not the only people who are interested in attitudes,
advertisers are as well. In fact, many psychology majors go into the field of
advertising. Because they learn about what motivates people, what influences
people or limits to sensation and perception, as well as how to measure
satisfactions. All of these things, motivation, influence, and sensation, and
perception are involved in advertising. Advertisers as well as many individuals
engage in something called persuasion. Persuasion is the phenomenon of changing
someone's beliefs or attitudes via communication by another person.
