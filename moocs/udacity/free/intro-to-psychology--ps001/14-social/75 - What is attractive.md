Research on attraction shows that people find average and symmetrical faces
more attractive than less average, less symmetrical faces. Now, by average, I
don't mean common. I mean mathematically average. So, the size, shape, and
location of facial features have to be the mathematical average of a
population. So, you can't have a face that's too big or too small, or eyes that
are too close together or too far apart. Now, why is it that we prefer
symmetry? Well, symmetry can be an indicator of genetic fitness. That is, more
symmetrical faces can be a sign of less genetic mutations, and thus a sign of
good genetic health.
