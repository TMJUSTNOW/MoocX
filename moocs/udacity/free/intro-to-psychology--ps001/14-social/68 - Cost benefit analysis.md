One thing to keep in mind before we get involved in a situation that we do a
cost-benefit analysis. Let's say for example, I see two grown men fighting in
the street. I'll stop and engage in a cost-benefit analysis and decide that if
I try to split the two men up by myself, I could possibly get hurt. And that's
something I wouldn't want to happen. Sometimes people don't offer assistance
because they fear the negative repercussions if they don't help adequately. Or
if they make a situation worse. But for now, let's go to Susan to talk more
about some pro-social behaviors.
