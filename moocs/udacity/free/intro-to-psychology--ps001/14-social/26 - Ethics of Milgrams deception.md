So, although we often think of deception as bad. And in many cases it is. But
even by today's standards, what Milgrim did, in his research, was actually not
unethical in terms of the deception. Because he did two things. He debriefed
his participants. And it was a necessary part of the design. In fact if you
think about it, research often needs to use some degree of deception because if
we told participants in advance what the study was about, and what our
hypotheses were, it would completely invalidate the results.
