Did you have any of these as your answers. Nationality perhaps, ethnicity,
college. For example, seeing those who went to Central Michigan University as
an out group if you went to Western Michigan University. Or perhaps a
fraternity or sorority. Even gender Gangs and cliques at school, are all
examples of potential in-group/out-group bias.
