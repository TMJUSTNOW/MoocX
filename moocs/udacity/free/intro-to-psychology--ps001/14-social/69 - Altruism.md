As I mentioned earlier, the bystander effect has generated much research in the
area of social psychology, and it continues to do so. Another area of study, of
pro-social behavior, for psychologists, is the idea of altruism. Altruism is
selfless attitudes and behaviors towards others, or showing a selfless concern
for others, and giving aid to them. Now why do you think that people act it
alturistic ways? Think about it for a moment.
