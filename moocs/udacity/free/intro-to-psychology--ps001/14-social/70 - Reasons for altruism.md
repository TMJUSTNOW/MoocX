Well, there are a number of reasons why we may behave in an altruistic way. So
let's look at a few. One evolutionary theory for altruism is kin selection. And
this refers to the evolutionary pressure for individuals to favor helping those
that are most genetically related to themselves. That is relatives or kin.
Another explanation for altruistic behavior is reciprocal altruism. This is the
idea that we help others in the hope that they will help us in the future. It
is much easier for us to survive as humans if we can cooperate with each other
and this type of altruism promotes cooperation.
