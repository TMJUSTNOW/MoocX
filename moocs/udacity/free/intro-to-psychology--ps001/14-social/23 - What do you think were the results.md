Before I give you the actual results of the experiment, Milgram surveyed
experts in the area such as psychiatrists. And asked them to predict how many
people would go up to 450 volts. He found from his research that 30% of the
people thought the teacher would administer a shock as high as 150 volts. Less
than 4% of the experts thought that the teacher would deliver a shock at 300
volts. And only one person in a 1,000 would go all the way to 450 volts.
