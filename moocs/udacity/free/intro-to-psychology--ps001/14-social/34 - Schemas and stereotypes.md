In addition to attributions we also use schemas to make sense of our world. Do
you remember when we talked about schemas and how as humans we try to
categorize things? Well, we do this with our social world when trying to form
impressions of other people, especially in ambiguous situations. And one way to
do this is through stereotypes. Stereotypes are schemas of how people are
likely to act, based on the group they belong to. We stereotypes that draw
inferences about people based on the knowledge we have of the categories to
which they belong.
