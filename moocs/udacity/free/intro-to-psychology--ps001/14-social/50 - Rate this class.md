I want to stop real quick and ask you a question. Are you enjoying this
psychology class? Tell me on a scale of one to ten. One being you absolutely
hate it. Ten being you love it and you can't wait for new material to come out.
Or you sat at your computer one day and did all of the available lessons
because it was too much fun to stop. And if you like the class at all, would
you mind changing your profile picture to this picture on your social media
page?
