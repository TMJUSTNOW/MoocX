Solomon Asch found that 76% of the people conformed with a group approximately
to what others are doing. Or they change their behavior to adhere to cultural
norms. And as we see, people go to great lengths to conform with others. And
this often happens in decision making. And psychologists have a technical term
for this and it's called group think. And group think can be dangerous because
an individual may forego critical analysis or logic in attempts just to fit in
with the group. For example, some psychologists and historians have suggested
that Kennedy's behavior in the Bay of Pigs actually resulted from group think.
