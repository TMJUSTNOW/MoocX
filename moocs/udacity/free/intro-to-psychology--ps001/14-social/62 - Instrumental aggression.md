So, in addition to hostile aggression, we also have what's known as
instrumental aggression. And instrumental aggression occurs when someone acts
aggressively. But in the service of achieving some particular goal. Good
examples of this happen often in sports. So, for instance, in hockey. Let's say
someone body checks someone real hard into the boards. In order to prevent that
person from getting the puck. This is instrumental aggression, because it's
used in the service of achieving a goal, in this case preventing the guy from
getting the puck. This is different from hostile aggression. Now we're going to
go to Lauren, for a word on biology and aggression.
