The answer is a large bacteria. Matt's going to tell you why.
&gt;&gt; Believe it or not, an Amoeba has more than 66 times more DNA than humans do.
While and Amoeba has 200 billion letters, humans only have 3 billion. So as you
can see, it's not the amount of DNA that makes a species complex. Otherwise,
the Amoeba would be the most complex organism of all. Instead, it matters what
the sequence of those letters in your DNA are, because they code very specific
instructions. Next, we'll see how that code can be turned into flesh and blood.
