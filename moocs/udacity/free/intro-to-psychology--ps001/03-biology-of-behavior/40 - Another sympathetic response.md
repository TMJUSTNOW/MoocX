It's the activation of the sympathetic nervous system that allows us to flee or
fight in dangerous situations. Here's a real example I like to share with my
students. I had completed almost a 13 hour hike to the top of Half Dome at
Yosemite National Park. I was exhausted, my knees hurt, I was so tired. I
didn't think I could make it down. When all of a sudden, somebody yelled, bear.
Sure enough my sympathetic nervous system became activated. I was able to run
almost the entire way down the remainder of the mountain, one mile. That is a
great example of fleeing or fighting and activation of the sympathetic nervous
system.
