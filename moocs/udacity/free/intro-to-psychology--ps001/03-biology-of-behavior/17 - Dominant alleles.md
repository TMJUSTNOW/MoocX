So, do all genes have this dominant and one recessive component?
&gt;&gt; It's a great question and the simple answer is no. Genetics is complicated. And
we just covered a very basic example of dominance. Complete dominance over
another allele. But there are examples where you have semi-dominance and
co-dominance. And all kinds of other different factors are important in
determining this. But, there are many cases where this simple dominance does
hold true.
