Our cerebrum is composed of four large areas called lobes, which each carry out
distinct functions. Our four lobes are frontal, parietal, occipital and
temporal. These lobes are bilateral, which means that they are located on the
left and the right sides of the brain. We should also point out that all of the
structures of the forebrain, the thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala,
and the cingulated gyrus, are bilateral. Meaning they exist in twos. On the
right, and on the left.
