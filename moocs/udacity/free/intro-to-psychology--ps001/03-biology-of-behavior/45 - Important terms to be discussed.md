Now, we just mentioned a bunch of terms that you may not be familiar with.
Visual cortex, occipital lobe, motor cortex, frontal lobe and motor and sensory
neurons. Don't worry. The rest of this lesson we will elaborate and discuss
these important parts of the brain. We will start with the smallest unit of
communication, the neuron. And then, discuss different kinds of neural
chemicals that make different experiences and different actions possible.
Finally, we will learn all of the major brain structures and their function.
The nervous system is comprised of cells. Which is what we will look at next to
see what the building blocks of the nervous system are.
