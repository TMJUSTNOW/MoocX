When our sensory neurons are activated, what occurs? Remember our sensory
neurons are important for receiving incoming information from our senses.
Touch, taste, smell and hearing. The sensory neurons carry signals from the
peripheral nervous system to the outer parts of the body to tell us how we
feel. The sensory neurons will carry signals from our senses to our central
nervous system. Or the sensory neurons will carry signals to the motor neurons,
which then send that message to the brain.
