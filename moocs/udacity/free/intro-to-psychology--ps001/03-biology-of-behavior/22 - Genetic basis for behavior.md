Well, we already know that our behavior is a result of what goes on in our
environment and in our brains. And our brains are essentially created by our
DNA. So, we know that our genes have some kind of connection with behavior, so
we know that the last one's not right. We also can guess that behaviors are
very complex. So, one gene controlling one behavior is probably not what's
going on. And even just a few genes regulating all behaviors is probably not
likely either. As you might have guessed, many genes are behind any given
particular behavior. And as we go through this course, you'll see exactly how
complex some of these behaviors can be.
