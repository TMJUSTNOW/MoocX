Now, I think it's important to stop and ask ourselves just why our
neurotransmitters so important?. Many medicines, as well as drugs of abuse,
affect neurotransmitters. For example, we learned that SSRIs, Selective
Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, prevent serotonin from being taken back up by
that neuron. Neurotransmitters are also important when we're looking at drugs
of abuse. For example, both cocaine and methamphetamine are drugs that increase
the amount of dopamine that's available in the synaptic cleft. Again, that
means dopamine can attach to those dopaminergic receptors.
