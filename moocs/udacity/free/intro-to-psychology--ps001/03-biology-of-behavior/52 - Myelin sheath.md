Here, I have another question for you. What does the myelin sheath do for the
axon? Remember, the myelin sheath wraps around the axon. Does it keep it
together so the impulse doesn't fall through the cracks? It insulates it making
the neuron more effective, or does it protect it from synapticitis when the
synapse eats the axon?
