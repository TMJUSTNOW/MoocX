Focusing in on human evolution, we'll see that modern humans have been around
for only about 200,000 years, but we're still going strong. Other human species
have been alive for a lot longer, but they're now extinct. Homo
neanderthalensis or neanderthals, lived from about 400,000 years ago to about
to about 300,000 years ago. And Homo habilus lived somewhere around 2.4 to 2.5
million years ago until about 1.4 million years ago. Modern humans also share
kinship with other living primates like modern chimpanzees.
