Natural selection has caused drastic physical changes in human evolution.
Including the ability to walk upright, the development of skin with far less

brain? The ability to store decades worth of information. The need for more
food or energy. Childbirth becoming more painful because of bigger heads. Or,
problem solving skills begin to develop. Go ahead and check any and all that
you think apply.
