Heartbeat is the autonomic nervous system because that's what controls our
involuntary systems, such as heartbeat or breathing. Feeling a soft blanket is
our somatic nervous system because it has to do with sensory input. The same
goes for smelling paint that's also one of the senses. And digesting food is
back to autonomic nervous system because that's another involuntary action.
