Epigenetic tags build up with age and silence particular genes. Often times
these tags are removed, allowing expression of previously silenced genes. Even
identical twins have different experiences and are exposed to different
factors. Think of things like junk food, versus a healthy diet or exercise
versus no exercise, smoking or not smoking. So, their epigenome becomes
increasingly different with age. This is the reason why one twin may develop
cancer, become obese or things like that, while the other one won't. They're
genetically identical, but epigenetically, they're different.
