The Central Nervous System is responsible for our brain and spinal cord. The
Peripheral Nervous System is responsible for our cells outside of the Central
Nervous System. And the Peripheral Nervous System is divided into the Somatic
Nervous System, which is responsible for processing our sensory information.
And the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for our involuntary
systems. And this is divided into the sympathetic nervous system, which is
responsible for our fight or flight response. And the Parasympathetic Nervous
System, which helps bring us back to normal.
