So if you chose the sensory neurons will carry signals from our senses to the
central nervous system, you are correct. Remember our sensory neurons perceive
information from touch, taste, smell and hearing. It relays that message to the
central nervous system, our brain and spinal chord. From there the brain
interrupts that information and activates our motor neurons. The motor neurons
allow us to move and behave appropriately. So remember, we have sensory neurons
that send information to the central nervous system. The brain interprets that
material and activates motor neurons which allow us to move and behave
appropriately.
