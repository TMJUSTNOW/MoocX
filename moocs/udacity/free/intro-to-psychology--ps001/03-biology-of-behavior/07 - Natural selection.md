Natural Selection, the driving force of evolution, takes a population of
organisms, and selects, only for those which are fit enough to survive. For
example, after a drought in the Galapagos Islands that leaves tough dry seeds
for bird food, only finches with big, durable beaks can crack open and eat the
seeds to survive. The rest will die. Thus, those genes that produces the big,
durable beaks are naturally selected for and passed down to the next
generation. Hopefully allowing their offspring to survive a drought as well.
This process of natural selection is responsible for shaping the genetic
information and development of every species as they evolve, including humans.
