So now that Susan explained classical conditioning, let's look back to when I
classically conditioned Greg, and identify the parts of classical conditioning.
Let's start here. Here I am with the bell. The bell originally didn't produce
any significant

response from Greg, other than maybe looking around. So what's the original
term we would give to the bell in this situation? Is it the unconditioned
stimulus? Is it the unconditional response, is it the conditioned response, or
is it the neutral stimulus?
