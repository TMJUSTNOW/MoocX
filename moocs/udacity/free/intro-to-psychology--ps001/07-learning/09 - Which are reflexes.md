So salivation is a reflex, when we put the sour candy in our mouth we
automatically salivate. Coughing is also a reflex that happens automatically
when particular stimuli affect your throat. Eye blink is also a reflex. And
even our startle response. Do you remember the loud noise you heard in the
earlier video? Perhaps that caused a startle response or even Gregg's startle
response by getting hit by the toy gun. The other responses clapping, skipping,
eating and talking do not happen automatically in response to particular
stimuli, so they are not reflexes.
