So on this graph we can look at the process of classical conditioning. On the
bottom we have successive trials, and on our vertical axis we have strength of
the condition response. Notice here we're pairing the condition stimulus with
the uncondition stimulus. That results in acquisition. Next, we present the
condition stimulus alone. Just the tone. And here, we see the strength of the
condition response decreases, and it eventually stops. This is extinction. Next
we have a rest period, where we do not present the tone to the dog. Following
the rest period we present the CS alone, and notice we do have a condition
response. This is term spontaneous recovery.
