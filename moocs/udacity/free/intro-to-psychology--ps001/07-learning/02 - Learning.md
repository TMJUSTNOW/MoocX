All of these questions can be answered with a simple term, learning. Learning
is defined as enduring changes in behavior that occur with experience. Learning
is fundamental to being successful in our environment. In this lesson, we're
going to cover three distinct types of learning. First, we're going to look at
the classic, Pavlov's dog and classical conditioning. Then, we're going to look
at B. F. Skinner and his rats, and operant conditioning. And, finally, we're
going to look at Albert Bandura's Bobo doll study and social learning.
