Now because this is an intro course, we can't go into depth into operant
conditioning, but I do want you to know that it's used across a variety of
disciplines and subfields. For example, we did see Dr. Zelig use operant
conditioning in her animal training and behavioral modification. We also know
that operant conditioning is used in treating drug dependence. People in
industrial organizational psychology use the principals of operant conditioning
to increase worker productivity as well as decrease accidents on the job site.
