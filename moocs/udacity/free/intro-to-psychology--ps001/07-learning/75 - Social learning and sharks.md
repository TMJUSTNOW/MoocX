Do you remember in the first lesson when I was pretty scared of that snake?
Well, it's a pretty common fear to have. But there's another animal that I'm
not scared of, that a lot of people are afraid of. And that's sharks, I love
sharks. One of the main reasons why I love sharks is because my big brother
Jay, is a professional shark diver. He takes me diving with him. He sends me
awesome pictures of him and sharks. And tells me how much he enjoys swimming
with these beautiful creatures.
