Researches conditioned men to be sexually aroused at the sight of black boots.
To do this they repeatedly showed men pictures of black boots followed by
pictures of nude women, then assessed their sexual arousal. At the end of the
study the participants were of course de-conditioned to the sight of black
boots. That way, when they were walking around and saw black boots they weren't
aroused.
