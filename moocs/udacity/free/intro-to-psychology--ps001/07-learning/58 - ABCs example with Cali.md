>> Yeah. So once the behavior has been trained, the antecedent is the cue or the
SD, the stimulus descriptive. Then the behavior would be her putting her head
back to her back. That's the behaviour, and then the consequence is the bridge
and the reinforcement. The bridge is a form of reinforcement and then the fish
being the other, primary form of reinforcement.
