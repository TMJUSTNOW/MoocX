So, before conditioning, the tone is a neutral stimulus. It elicits no specific
response other than perhaps an orienting response. After conditioning, the tone
is the condition stimulus. Prior to conditioning, the meat powder is an
unconditioned stimulus. It automatically elicits salivation, which brings us to
our unconditioned response. The dog salivating to the meat powder. Remember
after the conditioning, now we have our CS of the tone and the dog will
salivate the condition response to the tone. Great job if you got those right.
