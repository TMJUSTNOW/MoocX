The main thing I would say is for ethical reasons. Now, it's not fair to leave
Greg with his fear of bells. What if he's waiting in line at a deli and someone
hits a bell, then he jumps and he drops all his food because he's scared he's
going to hit with a toy gun. It might be kind of embarrassing for him, however,
one important reason why we would want to extinguish this fear is because of
something called generalization. I'm going to talk to you guys about
generalization using the classical conditioning example of the little Albert
study.
