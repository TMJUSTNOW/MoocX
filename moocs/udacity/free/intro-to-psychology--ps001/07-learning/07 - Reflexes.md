Reflexes are unlearned, automatic responses that occur when particular stimuli
are presented. It happens naturally, requires no learning history. So for
example if I were to put lemon juice in your mouth, you would automatically
salivate. So let's take a look at some examples. If I were to put a sour candy
in your mouth, you would automatically salivate to that particular stimulus,
the sour candy. Another example of a reflex is the eye blink. If you go to the
eye doctor and they test for glaucoma, they're going to put a puff of air in
your eye, and you are automatically going to blink to that particular stimulus,
the puff of air. That's another example of a reflex.
