Now, there are two distinct processes that control behavior. It's reinforcement
and punishment. A reinforcement always results in an increase in the future
likelihood a behavior will occur under similar circumstances. Meaning, if Saki
is always reinforced with fish or praise after giving a kiss, it's likely that
next time she is asked to give a kiss during a demonstration, that she's
going to do it. On the other hand, a punishment always results in the decreased
likelihood of a behavior occurring. So, for example, if Sake was punished every
time she gave a kiss, she would be less likely to do that behavior again. Now
let's go to an interview with Dr. Zeligs.
