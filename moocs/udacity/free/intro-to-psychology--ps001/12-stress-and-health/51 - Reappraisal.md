Loren on the other hand again uses emotion focus coping. And one way she can
use this technique is through reappraisal. Here, Loren looks at the situation
again in a new light. Being an avid scuba diver, she remembers the information
that her scuba instructor gave her, and that let her reappraise the stressful
situation. If Loren checks the tide tables, she could actually time her dive to
the changing tides and have a better dive if she gets in the water an hour
before high tide. This is great news for Lauren. So, now the negative emotions
have been replaced with positive ones. Excitement for the awesome dive.
