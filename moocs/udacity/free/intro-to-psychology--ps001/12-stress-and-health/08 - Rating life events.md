I want you to try this. I'm going to give you a list of life events and I want
you to place them on the number line according to the amount of stress you
think they cause. So we have death of a close family member, vacation,
retirement, marriage, begin or end school, death of a close friend, divorce and
pregnancy. Each of these correspond to one of these numbers on the scale. Where
do you think they go? Put the appropriate letter under the appropriate number
on the scale. Don't worry if you get this wrong. I had a few people try this,
and almost everybody came up with different ratings.
