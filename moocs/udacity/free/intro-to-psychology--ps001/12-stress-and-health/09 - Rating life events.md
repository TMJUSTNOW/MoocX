according to the social readjustment scale, death of a close family member
would have the rating of 63, vacation would have the rating of 13, retirement
is given a rating of 45, marriage is given a rating of 50. When you begin or
end school, that's given a rating of 26. The death of a close friend is given
the rating 37, divorce is a 73, and that leaves pregnancy as 40 on this scale
of stress. So, the key here is that we all interpret stress differently. But
according to the social readjustment rating scale, this is how they access
stressful life events. And don't forget the positive things such as marriage or
retirement can really be stressful.
