One effective way to handle stress and beat the negative impact stress has on
our bodies is through exercise. There is a great deal of research out there
showing just how important exercise can be in reducing the physiological
negative responses to stress. In fact exercise is beneficial to our overall
brain health specifically for our hippocampus. Engaging in regular exercise can
have great benefits to our bodies including lowering the risk of heart disease,
stroke and certain types of cancers. It can also ward off the onset of
diabetes. And, in fact, it can improve our overall emotional health, which can
result in a decrease likelihood of depression.
