Again, it's important to emphasize that it's a person's perceived ability to
handle a situation that plays a large role in how our body reacts to a
stressful event. Now what may be stressful to one person may not be stressful
to another. So two people can be exposed to the exact same virus and one person
may get sick and one person may not. All because of how they perceive the
stress they are under. Now have you ever gotten sick when you were under a lot
of stress? If so, what was that stressor?
