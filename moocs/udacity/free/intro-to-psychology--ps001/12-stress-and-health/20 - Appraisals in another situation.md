Now try the same thing for this scenario. Matthew forgot his bus pass at home,
and when he was about to get on the bus, he realized this. He became very
upset, and this caused a negative emotional reaction. While walking to school,
instead of riding the bus, he thought more carefully about the situation. And
realized that at he least he didn't lose the bus pass, it was safely at home.
So, he didn't have to spend money to replace it. Also, he realized that it was
good to get outside and enjoy some exercise on his walk to school. Identify the
part of this scenario that was a primary appraisal and the part there was a
secondary appraisal. Type your responses in these two boxes.
