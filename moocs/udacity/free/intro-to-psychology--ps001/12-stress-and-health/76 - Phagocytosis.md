What would you relate phagocytosis to? Our red blood cells spreading an
infection around so much that it dies off? Or is it something like our white
blood cells attack an infection like little superheroes and kill it? Or haul it
away to be destroyed, so, it can't cause any more damage? Or is it like our HPA
axis vacuuming everything that is bad and destroying it? Select one.
