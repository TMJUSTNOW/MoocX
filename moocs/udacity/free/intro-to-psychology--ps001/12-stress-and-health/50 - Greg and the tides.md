Greg and Lauren have a problem, the changing tides of the ocean causes them
stress. Greg faces a stressful event with his problem focus coping strategy
again. In problem focus coping Greg looks for strategies are ways to change a
situation so the stress is reduced. So Greg spends hours and hours trying to
find a way to stop the changing of the tide so he can enjoy a day at the beach
with his wife and two sons. However, as we know, this is a problem he is not
going to be able to change. Poor Greg.
