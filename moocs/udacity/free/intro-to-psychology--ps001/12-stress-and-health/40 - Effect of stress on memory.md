It's bad to try and cram for a test, remember a shopping list, or learn
something new when you're really stressed. Because cortisol affects the brain
by inhibiting plasticity and damages dendrites, which interferes with memory.
So, you won't be able to remember what you studied for the test, or what's on
the shopping list, or the new things that you learned.
