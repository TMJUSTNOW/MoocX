The cardiovascular system is comprised of our heart and all of the blood
vessels in our body. Now, unfortunately, the cardiovascular system is
especially susceptible to the effects of sustained arousal. Under the
conditions of sustained arousal, our heart rate and blood pressure elevate and
remain elevated over a period of time. This can damage arteries. And increase
the likelihood of fatty buildup. This in turn can result in heart disease.
Again, this demonstrates just how important it is to reduce stress in our daily
lives. Because of its negative consequences on the immune system, as well as
the poteential damage to our cardiovascular health.
