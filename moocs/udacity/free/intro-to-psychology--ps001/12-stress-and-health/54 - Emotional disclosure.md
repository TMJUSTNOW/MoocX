The last strategy that we'll talk about in emotion focused coping is a
technique developed by psychologist James Pennebaker and it's called emotional
disclosure. In emotional disclosure, an individual writes or talks about the
stressful situation. And research has shown this can have positive outcomes.
For example, some researchers found that individuals with cancer and HIV Aids.
Who engaged in emotional disclosure actually had better health outcomes than
those who did not.
