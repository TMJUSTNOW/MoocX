a given situation, and we know how our body responds to stress, how is it that
we handle stress? Well, psychologists call our ability to handle or deal with
stress, coping. Now as it turns out, there are two distinct coping strategies.

focuses on changing one's emotional response, or regulating your emotional
response to a stressful situation. The first is called problem-focused coping,
