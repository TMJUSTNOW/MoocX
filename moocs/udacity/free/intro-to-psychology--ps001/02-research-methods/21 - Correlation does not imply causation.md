Well in fact, there's many variables that can influence the number of drowning
deaths. So I can swim here because I'm in a city where it's warm and near the
ocean. So location and climate can both influence the number of drowning
deaths. But they can also influence the number of ice cream cones people eat.
In fact, there's a ton of reasons why ice cream cone consumption can be related
to drowning death. But this correlation does not imply causation. So, how can
we determine whether one thing causes the other? We have to do what's called an
experimental study. So, why don't we head back to my office and see if we can
come up with a good experiment to do?
