Now that we have an idea about the different variables involved in experimental
studies, let's go back to our study about caffeine and reaction time. We're
going to vary the amount of our independent variable, which was caffeine, that
we give to different participants. That brings us to the different groups, part
of our sentence. Say we're going to use two groups. One group gets caffeine.
And one group does not get caffeine. Why do you think it's important that we
have these two groups. Is it because we want to get a baseline to compare the
caffeine group to? Is it because some people might not want caffeine? Or is
having two groups a bad idea and everybody should get caffeine?
