In our first example, participants reported how often they watched television.
This is subjective; we're relying on their input. However, in the next example,
we actually had people go in and measure the number hours they watched. That
would be objective. Again, with our third example, college students reporting
the number of hours they studied, we can't verify that so that would be
subjective. They self-reported. We can however, objectively measure the heart
rate of students watching a horror movie. Finally, measuring the number of
pounds students lost after running three times a week, again, would be an
objective measure.
