Flipping a coin is the best option because it's random. So, the logic here is
that there's a million different variables that can effect somebody's reaction
time. Whether you're old or young, male or female or how much you slept last
night. All of these things may or may not influence reaction time, but these
aren't the variables we're interested in.
