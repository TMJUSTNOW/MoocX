Why is it a good not to tell the participants what group they're in? Is it
because they will try to sneak into another group? It reduces bias because they
may change how they react if they know if they are or are not getting the
independent variable? Or it won't change anything. They should know what group
they're in. Choose whatever answer you think is correct.
