We need to be able to get a baseline to compare our caffeine group to. In an
experimental study, there are two types of groups. There's the experimental
group and there's the control group. The control group receives the same exact
treatment as the experimental group. The only difference is the independent
variable. So, in our case, our control group does not receive caffeine. Our
independent variable, but the experimental group does.
