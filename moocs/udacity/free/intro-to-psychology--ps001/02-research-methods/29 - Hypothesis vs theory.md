Now I just wanted to add a quick note about hypotheses and theories. The
hypothesis is a testable question. It's like an if then statement. For example,
if someone drinks caffeine, then their reaction time will decrease. A theory,
on the other hand, is a well substantiated and unifying explanation for a set
of proven hypotheses. So if you take all of the research in one area, you put
it together, you come up with a theory. Now theories can change with developing
research. But in general, a theory is our current view of a topic.
