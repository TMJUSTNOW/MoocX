We want to measure the effect of caffeine on reaction time in Udacity
employees. There are many ways we can do this. But which of the following do
you think is best? Should we find employees who've already had a varying amount
of caffeine and measure their reaction time and see if it changes between them?
Should we give caffeine in varying amounts to different groups of employees and
then measure their reaction times. Should we ask people who have already had
caffeine how they feel their reaction times have been affected? Pick which one
you think is best. Don't worry if you don't know the answer just yet, but take
a second and try to think about it.
