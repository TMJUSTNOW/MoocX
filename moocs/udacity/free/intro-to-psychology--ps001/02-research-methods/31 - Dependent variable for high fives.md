The correct answer is happiness. That is our dependent variable. Because
happiness is what we're measuring by using smiles which is how we are
operationalizing our construct happiness. Happiness is our construct. A
construct is a psychological concept that we can't necessarily see or touch and
it has to be measured indirectly. And that's why we come up with an operational
definition. We have to find a way to measure happiness. So we operationalize
happiness with the number of smiles. That just means when someone smiles we
interpret it as happiness.
