If you chose this graph you're correct. As scores increase on the x-axis, they
decrease on the y-axis. This scattered plot would indicate no relationship.
Here we would have a positive relationship. As scores increase on x they also
increase on y. Note, the .4. It's not as we had a perfect correlation. Instead,
we have a moderate relationship.
