Now that you've learned the difference between objective and subjective
measures, let's see if you can identify some examples. Participants reported
how often they watched television per week. Researchers measured the number of
hours children watched television per week. College students reported the
number of hours they studied per week. Researchers measured the heart rate of
students watching a horror movie. Researches measured the number of pounds
students lost after running three times a week for one month. For each of the
examples given, check whether you think it is an objective measure or a
subjective measure.
