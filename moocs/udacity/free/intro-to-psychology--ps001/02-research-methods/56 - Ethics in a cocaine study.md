Although the first option of randomly assigning pregnant woman to an
experimental group. And giving them cocaine would give us excellent
experimental control. We have to remember about ethics and it would be
unethical to force woman to take cocaine. It would also be unethical to give
cocaine to babies to see what it does. That leaves us with the option of
finding women. Who used cocaine while they were pregnant. Then, we can study
their babies. That would be most ethical.
