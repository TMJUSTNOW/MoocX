The best way to do this would be to give caffeine in varying amounts to
different groups of employees. Then measure their reaction time. The first
option and the third option are both correlational studies. We don't want to
use those if we want to see if caffeine effects reaction time. So look at this
last one. This one uses what we call a self report measure. We're going to talk
more about that later, but it's not a very good way to measure reaction time.
