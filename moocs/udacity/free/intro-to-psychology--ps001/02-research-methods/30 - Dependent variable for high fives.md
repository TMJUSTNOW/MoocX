Here we would say that there are two levels of the IV, or independent variable.
Giving high fives and no high fives. It's important to remember that I'm
treating the two groups exactly the same way. The only difference is one is
getting high fives. And the other is not, so I'm only manipulating the
independent variable. So, now that we know what the independent variable is,
what is the dependent variable? My coworkers, happiness, or high fives? Select
the one you think is a dependent variable.
