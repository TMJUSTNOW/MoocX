So for my high five example, I had to come up with a hypothesis, which is like
an if-then statement. It's a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. So I think
that if I give my co-workers high fives then they will be happier. So I gave
one group high fives. That was my experimental group and then I gave the other
group no high fives, that was my control group. Then I counted the number of
smiles front he people one act group. So what is the independent variable in
this study? Is it high fives, is it happiness, or is it my co workers? Select
which one you think is the independent variable...
