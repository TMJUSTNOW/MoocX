In our ice cream cones and drowning deaths example, what other factors do you
think could have contributed to the number of drowning deaths and the number of
ice cream cones consumed? Could it be the location of where the study took
place? Could it be the number of people swimming during the study? Could it be
the climate of where the study took place? Or could it be the overall
population of where the study took place? Chose as many or as few of these as
you would like.
