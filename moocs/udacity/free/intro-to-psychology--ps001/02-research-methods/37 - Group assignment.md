Now that we have all the participants, how do you think we should assign them
into the two different groups? Should we have each participant flip a coin and
put them in the experimental group that gets caffeine if their coin lands on
heads? And put them in the control group without caffeine if their coin lands
on tales? Should one group be males and the other group be females? Should the
first half of the participants who show up get caffeine and the second half of
the participants who show up not get caffeine? Should the people who normally
have caffeine be in the experimental group? And, the people who don't normally
have caffeine be in the control group? Select the best option.
