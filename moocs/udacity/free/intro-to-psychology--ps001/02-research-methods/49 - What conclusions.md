Before we talk about our results. If we did find that the experimental group,
the one that got caffeine had significantly faster reaction times than the
control group. The ones without caffeine. What conclusion can we draw, caffeine
causes faster reaction time, caffeine is correlated with reaction times? But we
cannot make a causal statement about this relationship. There is no
relationship. Select which one you think is best.
