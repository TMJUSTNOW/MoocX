The best option here is to use a computer based time test. Using a computer
based test, like this one, to test our reaction time is best because it gives
us an objective measure of reaction time. Now objective measures aren't biased
by the researcher like a subjective measure can be. For example, if I watch
participants then decided to rank their alertness on a scale from one to 10,
that I just arbitrarily made up. That wouldn't give us a really accurate
reaction time.
