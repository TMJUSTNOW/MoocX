So, there are two main scientific theories of human intelligence, but before we
get into those theories, let's remember what scientific theories are all about.
Scientific theories explain and organize the known evidence on a given topic.
It's important to remember, though, that good scientific theories, are always
open to change, based on that scientific evidence. So, scientific theories make
testable predictions, and we test those predictions, with empirical studies.
The results of those studies, then, lead scientists to either confirm,
disconfirm, or modify, their theories. So now I'm going to send you over to
Lauren to talk about the two theories of human intelligence.
