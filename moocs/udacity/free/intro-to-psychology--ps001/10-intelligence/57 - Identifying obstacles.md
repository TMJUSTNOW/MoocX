Now if you struggled with this problem, you probably had a problem with your
fixation. You couldn't break out of the mindset and look at it from a new
perspective, so thinking outside of the box. And for this one, it'd be
functional fixedness. For this one you probably didn't think pliers could be
used as a weight for the rope to swing it over so you could grab it and tie the
two ropes together. So this concludes my portion of the lesson. I'm going to
send you back to Greg so he can give you the wrap up on the whole intelligence
lesson.
