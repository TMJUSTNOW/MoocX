Now, of course we know that there is obstacles we face when trying to solve
problems, that make them very difficult to solve. Two common obstacles to
solving problems are fixation and functional fixedness. Fixation is the
inability to break out of a mind-set and think about a problem from a new a
fresh perspective. And functional fixedness is being fixed on seeing things as
we're used to seeing them. And being unable to see unusual uses for everyday
things or procedures.
