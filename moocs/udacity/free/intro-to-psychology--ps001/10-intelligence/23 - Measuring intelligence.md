Now all of these theories are great, but there's a problem here. Say we need to
see if a drug can affect a child's intellectual development, well we need to
have a way to measure intelligence. But how do we measure intelligence? Well
the first thing you need to know is that intelligence is what psychologists
call a hypothetical construct. Meaning it's an idea that can't be directly seen
or measured, so it can only be indirectly measured.
