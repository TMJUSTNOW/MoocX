People with learning disabilities, need to be assessed differently, because IQ
doesn't really work for them. In fact, we have that. It's called the Adaptive
Skills Test, and what the Adaptive Skills Test is all about, is assessing every
day functioning. So how well you understand what people are saying can you feed
yourself, can you dress yourself. And things like that. So, adaptive skills
tests are better ways of assessing intellectual functioning in people with
disabilities than IQ tests are.
