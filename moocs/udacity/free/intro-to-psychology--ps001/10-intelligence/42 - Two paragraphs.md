So this first paragraph in fact, was written by the great novelist James Joyce
and it's from his novel Ulysses. And this, we can deem quite creative, in fact
it was, because it did something quite different. Not only different, but
unique. So the second paragraph was authored by someone suffering from
schizophrenia. And who's speaking really in what we call word solid. And this
is not creative. So these two quotes demonstrate that creativity is something
more than just originality. What it is and what it isn't. They're both equally
original but the first also solve the problem in an adaptive and useful way.
