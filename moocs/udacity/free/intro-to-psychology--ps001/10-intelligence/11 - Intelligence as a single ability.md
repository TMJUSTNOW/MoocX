Charles Spearman developed one of the first theories of intelligence. He
believed that intelligence is a single general capacity or ability. The reason
for his belief is that he found that although intelligence test assessed math,
language, and spatial ability. Children's scores on these domains, tend to be
positively correlated. Meaning, those who scored high on one dimension, for
example, math, tend to score high on others, such as language, or spatial
skills. Likewise, those who scored on low on one dimension, tended to score low
on others.
