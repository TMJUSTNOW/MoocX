Psychologists have looked in the all different types of problem solving.
They've learned a thing or two about what helps and what hinders us in our
ability to solve problems. Now, before we get started in problem solving, I
want you to try this. Now, imagine you're in a room, and there's two strings
hanging from the ceiling. You can reach each string individually. But, the
strings are too far apart for you to reach them both at the same time. What's
also in the room is a set of pliers, like these. Now, if you had to connect
these 2 strings together, how would you do it.
