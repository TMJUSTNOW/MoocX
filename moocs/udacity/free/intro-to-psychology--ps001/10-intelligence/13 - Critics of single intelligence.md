Critics of Spearman's theory of single intelligence didn't think that it did
justice to the complexity of intelligence. Although the domains that were
tested were moderately to highly correlated with each other, critics didn't
think that these domains accurately showed all of intelligence. In other words,
they questioned the validity of this theory.
