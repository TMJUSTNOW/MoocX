Here, I want you to try this. Take out a sheet of paper and reproduce the nine
dots you see here,,just like this. The task is to connect all nine dots with
just four straight lines. When you are doing it, you can't pick up your pen or
pencil from the paper and you can't retrace a line that you've already made. Go
ahead and try it. Take a minute or two and we'll give you the answer. Don't
worry if you struggle with it, I did too.
