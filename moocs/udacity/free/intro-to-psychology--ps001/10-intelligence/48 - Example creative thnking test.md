This is an example of a creative thinking test, the alternate uses test. This
test consists of a list of everyday objects, such as a brick or a newspaper,
and asks the person to come up with as many different uses for an object as
they can in a three minute period. The answers are scored on how original they
are as compared to thousands of other responses people have given. How many
answers they can come up with and how flexible their answers are meaning, how
many different categories of answers people can come up with. Now creative
people have more ideas, more flexible ideas and more original ideas than less
creative people.
