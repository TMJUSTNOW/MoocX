So, what do you think of when you think intelligence? Do you think about a
smart person? I know a lot of us do. But if you had to guess, which form of
life here do you think has intelligence? Do flowers? Do trees? Bacteria, worms,
spiders, the snake like tickles? A cat, a dog, a dolphin, a chimp, a human,
what has intelligence? Choose as many or as few as you'd like.
