At least two lines of research have looked at the critical importance of
bonding, attachment, and social stimulation in a child's development. First, is
Harry Harlow. In the 1950s, he wanted to examine what was more important: food
or affection. Now, for ethical reasons you'll see in a moment he was unable to
use human infants. So instead, he used baby monkeys.
&gt;&gt; He did so by manipulating food and affection. He created two mothers. One was a
wire mother that offered food. The other was a cloth mother that offered
affection and warmth.
&gt;&gt; Now the baby monkeys had an opportunity to chose either mother.
