Neuroplasticity in brain growth is not just an abstract idea. It can have
serious and powerful effects on who we become. The brain is growing most as a
fetus, and this is when we can get things really right or really wrong. What a
pregnant mother eats or otherwise takes into her body, such as drinking
something or chemical exposure, can dramatically affect brain development.
Teratogens, or substances that can cause permanent damage to the developing
embryo or fetus are really important here.
