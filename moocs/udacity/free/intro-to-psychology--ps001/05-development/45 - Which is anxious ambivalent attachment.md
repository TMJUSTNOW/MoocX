This is a right choice. Let me explain. About 10 to 15% of babies have an
anxious and ambivalent attachment style. Babies are distressed most of the
time, especially when the caregiver leaves. Babies go to the caregiver when he
or she returns but there are no warm hugs and there might even be some pushing
away of the caregiver.
