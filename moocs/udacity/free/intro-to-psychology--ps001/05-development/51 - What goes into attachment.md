The baby spent nearly all of its time with this mother, and would even cling to
this mother to lean over to feed from the wire mother. This really showed us
that food and nutrition aren't the only things that go into attachment. We need
a warm secure caregiver also to form an attachment. So remember then we see
that attachment is not just about food and nutrition. In fact other studies
have shown that animals will choose a fake mother that resembles their own.
