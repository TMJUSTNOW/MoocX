One interesting way we learned about babies' vision and depth perception is
with the visual cliff task. And that's this. The researcher puts the baby on
one end of the platform, and then there's a piece of plexiglass on the other
side. This is so it looks like visual cliff. Then, the researcher asks the mom
to stand on the other side of the plexiglass, so she would stand here. And she
would call the baby to come to her. What do you think the baby would do? Type
your answer here.
