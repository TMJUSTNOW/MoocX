Again, this is neural-plasticity in action. Neurons develop and are strengthen
with use and stimulation and die off when not used. That's why stimulation is
so important. Especially for babies and toddlers who have tonnes of neurons
waiting to form connections. After a year or two of being neglected or
under-stimulated socially, emotionally, or cognitively. There's a noticable
difference between toddlers who were stimulated, and toddlers who were under
stimulated.
