Developmental psychologists have discovered some changes that occur in late
adulthood, beginning in the late 60s and early 70s. These changes are slower
processing and limited working memory, but this is universal, it's not
dementia, which is a much more serious form of cognitive impairment. We do see
however that as neural processing slows down it doesn't stop. Therefore, people
in their 70s can learn lot's of new things, such as languages and even new
technologies.
