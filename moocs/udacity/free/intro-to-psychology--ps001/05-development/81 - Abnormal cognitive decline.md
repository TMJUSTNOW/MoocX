An abnormal cognitive decline is sometimes seen in some people in late
adulthood, and this is called dementia. The most common form of dementia, I'm
sure some of you've heard of is called Alzheimer's disease. This is a
degenerative disease of the brain that seriously impairs cognitive functioning,
for example, memory, language, and mood. It eventually impares brain
functioning so much that it leads to a loss of bodily control and function, and
eventually death.
