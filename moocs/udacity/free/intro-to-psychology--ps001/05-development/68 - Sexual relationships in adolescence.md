As teens we start to identify less with our parents, and we may even reject
them. Or at least their social beliefs and opinions. And we start to agree more
with our friends and our peers. Of course, a major focus of our teenage years
is on sexual relationships, whether that be reality or fantasy. Sexual thoughts
occupy a lot of a teenager's mind, and it's really common for teens to talk
about sexual relationships with their friends.
