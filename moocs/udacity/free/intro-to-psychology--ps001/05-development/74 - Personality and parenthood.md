It's interesting to note that most adults become parents. However, when they
become parents seems to be particularly associated with personality. For
example, one study found that shy men have children later in life than
extroverted or outgoing men do. On the other hand, Shy women actually have
children sooner than extroverted or outgoing women. Why do you think this is?
