The answer is Veronica. Susan has a PhD, I have a Master's Degree, she's
awesome at recess, but still, it's the baby who has the most neurons. I know,
it's crazy. I couldn't believe it when I first learned this either, but we have
more neurons at age two than we have at any other time in our lives. But
neurons only function when they're sending coordinated signals between other
neurons. So, as we develop and learn more, and get more control over our
bodies, neurons become more and more solidly connected. Remember from the brain
lesson? Again, this goes with the if you don't use it, you lose it. Neurons
that are not used are in fact lost.
