This is similar to what Piaget did. He took a toy from a six to seven month old
infant, and then covered it up with a blanket or towel. And found that infants
would look at this and be really confused, but then just go on to do something
else, because they totally that the toy even exists. This is what Piaget called
object permanence. The abilitiy to understand an object is permemant even if
you can't sense it. This is why babies think pee a boo is so much fun. The
adult keeps appearing and disappearing behind their hands. But notice that
infants grow out of enjoying pee a boo when they develop the cognitive
capability to understand object permanence.
