In addition to our cognitive development, our social and emotional development
is really important. Why do you think it is that mammals and birds are so
connected to our caregivers early in life, but fish and reptiles aren't? Well,
it's a bit complicated, but it really boils down to this: mammals and birds
need our caregivers to survive. Fish and reptiles don't. Warm blooded animals
form close bonds with their care givers. This is what psychologists call
attachment. Now, Greg is going to explain to you guys about the first
psychologist who showed us just how important attachment is in development.
