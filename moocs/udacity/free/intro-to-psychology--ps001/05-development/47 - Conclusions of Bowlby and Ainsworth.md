believed that attachment was based on how a parent interacted with the child.
If the parent was secure and warm towards the child, then the child would have

this is an over simplification. Children are born with a biologically based
temperament. Some are really easy going, others might get distressed really
easily. It's temperament that interacts with parenting style, and that creates
attachment style.
