No one has to be told that adolescence is about friendships and relationships.
Now, rejection is not easy at any age, but itâ€™s especially traumatic during
your teenage years. Because nothing is more important than being accepted and
liked by your peers. Thatâ€™s why teens who are bullied or rejected are at a much
higher risk of suicide. The other important social change during adolescence is
a shift from your family to your friends as your main source of social support.
