Babies put things in their mouths to figure out what the object is. Is it food?
Is it not food? That's pretty high-level thinking. Remember, they just have to
use their sense organs. This is the motor part of the sensory motor stage. The
babies have to move around, pick up objects in order to interact with their
world.
