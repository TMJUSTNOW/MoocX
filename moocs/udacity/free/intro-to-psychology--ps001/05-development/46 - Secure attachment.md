The final attachment style is secure attachment, and about 65% of babies have a
secure attachment. Babies with secure attachments cry and become really
distressed when the caregiver leaves. But when the caregiver returns, the baby
offers warm hugs, and the baby will settle down fairly quickly. Attachment is a
great example of how nature and nurture both influence our development. We are
born with a temperament which can influence how we attach to our caregivers,
but we also have to consider nurture or the experience our caregivers provide
us. This can also affect our attachment to them.
