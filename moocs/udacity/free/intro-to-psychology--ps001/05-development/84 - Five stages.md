Initially, when first learning of their limited time, people often deny it
thinking no doc, you must have had the wrong chart. Next, people often get
angry and feel upset, that why is this happening to me? This isn't fair. That's
followed by bargaining, which involves negotiating with God for more time.
Please, if you just let me live, I promise, blank. When it finally hits that
this really is the end, people often feel depressed and a sense of hopelessness
prevails. Next, death and all that it means can be accepted and even embraced.
People are at peace with their impending exit from this earth.
