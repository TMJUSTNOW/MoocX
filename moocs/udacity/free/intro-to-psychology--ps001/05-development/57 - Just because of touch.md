The outcome after a few months was dramatic. Babies who are touched gained
weight faster, left the hospital sooner, and also had less cognitive and
physical deficits. They also had higher IQ's at age three. All this was just
because of touch. We now know that touch stimulates neural development. So it's
now common practice for hospitals to allow newborns to rest on their mother's
chest immediately following birth unless there's a serious reason to believe
that the newborn is in trouble.
