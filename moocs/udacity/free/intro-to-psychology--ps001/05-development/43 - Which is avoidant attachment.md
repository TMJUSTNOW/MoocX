This is the correct option. Here, let me explain. About 20 to 25% of babies
have an avoidant attachment style. Ainsworth described this as a baby who is
not distressed at any time. Not when the caregiver leaves, not when the
caregiver returns. And there's no warm hugs or affection at any time either.
The caregiver is basically ignored.
