# [Building A Search Engine] (http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs101/)

====================================

## Udacify

### Define a procedure, `udacify`, that takes as input a string, and returns a string that  is an uppercase `'U'` followed by the input string.

```python
# print udacify('dacians')
# the output should be the string 'Udacians'
# Make sure your procedure has a return statement.

def udacify(input):
    return 'U' + input
```


## Proc

### Which of the following have exactly the same behaviour as the procedure

```python
def proc(a, b):
    if test(a):
        return b
    return a
```

- **(a)**

     ```python
     def proc1(x, y):
         if test(x):
             return y
         else:
             return x
     ```

- **(b)**

    ```python
    def proc2(a, b):
        if not test(b):
            return a
        else:
            return b
    ```

- **(c)**

    ```python
    def proc3(a, b):
        result = a
        if test(a):
            result = b
        return result
    ```

- **(d)**

    ```python
    def proc4(a, b):
        if not test(a):
            b = 'udacity'
        else:
            return b
        return a
    ```


**Answer:** (a), b) & (d)


## Median

### Define a procedure, `median`, that takes three numbers as its inputs, and outputs the median of the three numbers.

```python
def bigger(a,b):
    if a > b:
        return a
    else:
        return b
        
def biggest(a,b,c):
    return bigger(a,bigger(b,c))

def median(a, b, c):
    largest = biggest(a, b, c)

    if a == largest:
        between = bigger(b, c)
        return between
    if b == largest:
        between = bigger(a, c)
        return between
    if c == largest:
        between = bigger(a, b)
        return between              
```


## Blastoff

### Define a procedure, `countdown`, that takes a positive whole number as its input, and prints out a countdown from that number to 1, followed by Blastoff! 

```python
def countdown(n):
    while n >= 0:
        if n == 0:
            print "Blastoff!"
        else:
            print n
        n -= 1
```


## Finish

### For each loop below, answer if the loop always finishes no matter what positive value is assigned initially to `n`

**Loop 1**

```python
n = any positive integer
i = 0
while i <= n:
    i = i + 1
```

**Loop 2**

```python
n = any positive integer
i = 1
while True:
    i = i * 2
    n = n + 1
    if i > n:
        break
```

**Loop 3**

```python
n = any positive integer
while n != 1:
    if n % 2 == 0: # the % means remainder, so this tests if n is even
        n = n / 2
    else:
        n = 3 * n  +  1
```


**Answer:** (a), (b)  Always Finish, (c) is unknown to anyone


## Find Last

### Define a procedure, `find_last`, that takes as input two strings, a search string and a target string, and outputs the last position in the search string where the target string appears, or `-1` if there are no occurences.

```python
def find_last(a, b):
    i = -1
    while True:
        pos = a.find(b, i+1)
        if pos == -1:
            return i
        i = pos

print find_last('aaaa', 'a')
print find_last("", "b")
print find_last("", "")
```

## Multiplication Table

### Define a procedure, `print_multiplication_table`, that takes as input a positive whole number, and prints out a multiplication, table showing all the whole number multiplications up to and including the input number. The order in which the equations are printed must match exactly.

```python
def print_multiplication_table(n):
    i = n
    start = 1
    while i > 0:
        temp = 1
        while temp <= n:
            print "%d * %d = %d" % (start, temp, start*temp)
            temp += 1
        i -= 1
        start += 1
```
