Ricky is the Judge in a criminal trial. After all of the evidence has been heard, Ricky has to decide whether the defendant is guilty. Ricky thinks the evidence is quite convincing but not overwhelmingly so. He decides that he really doubts that the defendant committed the crime, but that there’s a chance that he did, so he finds the defendant guilty. Should the defendant have been found guilty?

Yes. The prosecution obviously showed that there’s a good chance the defendant committed the crime, so he should be found guilty and punished.

Yes. Ricky is a Judge, so he has the power to decide whether a defendant is guilty. It doesn’t matter how he comes to his decision.

No. The standard of proof in criminal cases is ‘beyond reasonable doubt’, which Ricky has not applied here.

Maybe, depending on what crime was committed.
