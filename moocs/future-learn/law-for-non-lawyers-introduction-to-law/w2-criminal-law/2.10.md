# Case study 2: Hungry Harry

[0:05Skip to 0 minutes and 5 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/177747#)PROFESSOR: Hungry Harry is walking down Average Avenue. He passes Fruity Francesca's house and front garden. Hungry Harry hasn't eaten for ages. He's really starving. He reaches over the fence and picks a peach from Francesca's peach tree. Has Harry committed a crime? Is the fact that Harry was starving a defense to any offense he may have committed? Fruity Francesca also has juicy grapes overhanging her fence onto the street. Hungry Harry picks a bunch of grapes from the vine. He thinks they must be everybody's property because it's on the street. Is Harry right? Fruity Francesca sees Harry picking her fruit and she's not very happy about it. She rushes to the gate to confront him.

She falls backwards and she dies. Will Harry be charged with something? Does he have any defense? Does it make any difference if Harry was intoxicated at the time?

Watch “Hungry Harry” for everyday examples that you may not think are a criminal offences.
