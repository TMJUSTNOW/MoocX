# Reflect and connect

You’ve learned more about basic common law criminal offences and defences, and explored the goals of criminal law through the case studies. It’s now your turn to reflect and share your thoughts with other learners.

## Talking point

What’s the most surprising thing you found out about criminal law from the case studies and its analysis, and how has it changed your attitude towards the law?
