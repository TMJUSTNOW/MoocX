# Reflect and connect

You’ve explored criminal law and learned more about its goals and how it classifies and organises offences. It’s now your turn to reflect and share your thoughts with other learners.

## Talking point

Within the **Discussion**, consider sharing with other learners your thoughts on the following questions:

- What’s the most surprising thing you found out about criminal law from the case study and its analysis?
- Is the criminal law an effective way of ensuring community safety, or do you think there are better ways of achieving this?

Don’t forget to contribute to the discussion by reviewing comments made by other learners, making sure you provide constructive feedback and commentary. You can also ‘like’ comments or follow other learners throughout the course.
