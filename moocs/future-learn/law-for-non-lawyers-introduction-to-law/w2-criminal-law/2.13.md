# Law in your backyard

The “Hungry Harry” case study explored theft and manslaughter. It’s now time for you to discover how the law applies in your jurisdiction.

## What you need to do

1. Go online and find the law and penalties for theft and manslaughter in your jurisdiction. If you live in Australia, consider finding out about the law and penalties from another State or common law jurisdiction.
2. In the **Comments**, share with other learners your findings.

What’s the definition of theft in your jurisdiction, and how does the law distinguish between public and private? Is there an easy and clear distinction between murder and manslaughter in your jurisdiction, and how would you explain it?

If you’re not sure how to find law resources, watch Caroline’s [How to start finding the law](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/177718) and [How to access online law resources](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/177719) to learn how to access and search for legal information online.
