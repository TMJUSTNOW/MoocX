# Law in your backyard

The “Texting Tim” case study explored different types of offences that can be committed while driving a car in Australia. It’s now time for you to discover how the law applies in your jurisdiction.

## What you need to do

1. Go online and find the law and applicable penalties for driving-related offences in your jurisdiction. If you live in Australia, consider finding out about the law and penalties in another State or from another common law jurisdiction.
2. In the **Comments**, share with other learners your findings.

If you’re not sure how to find law resources, watch Caroline’s [How to start finding the law](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/177718) and [How to access online law resources](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/177719) to learn how to access and search for legal information online.
