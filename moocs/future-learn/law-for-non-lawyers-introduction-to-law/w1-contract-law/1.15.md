# Reflect and connect

You’ve explored contract law and learned more about how it operates and protects consumers. It’s now your turn to reflect and share your thoughts with other learners.

## Talking point

Within the **Discussion**, consider sharing with other learners your thoughts on the following questions:

- What’s the most surprising thing you found out about contract law and how has it changed the way you behave as a consumer?
- Has the law in your home country struck the rights balance of allowing individuals the freedom to negotiate and enter into contracts, as well as the right amount of protections and guarantees for consumers?
- Have you bought something online? Do you feel safe buying items from internet based stores and accepting their ‘terms and conditions’ as presented to you online? If yes, why? If not, why not?

Don’t forget to contribute to the discussion by reviewing comments made by other learners, making sure you provide constructive feedback and commentary. You can also ‘like’ comments or follow other learners throughout the course.
