[0:04Skip to 0 minutes and 4 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/177724#)NARRATOR: Two brothers are bouncing on a trampoline, and the older one asks the other one to go and fetch them some drinks of water. "OK," says the younger brother. "I'll get the drinks, if you pay me $1,000." The older brother says, "sure." Upon returning with the drinks, the younger brother demands his $1,000 for the completed contract. Can he enforce this? Did the brothers have a binding verbal contract? Sick Simone goes to see Dr. Denise. "If you give me $5,000 for my renovations," says Dr. Denise, "I'll see you in the future without an appointment." Simone agrees to this, but later, she's not so sure she made the right decision. Does Dr. Denise have an enforceable contract with Sick Simone?

But when they arrive, she doesn't feel they are of acceptable quality. She clicked the "I agree" button at the time of the transaction. She didn't read the terms and conditions, so she wasn't aware that she'd agreed to waive her statutory rights. Can she return the goods or refuse to pay for them? Does it make any difference if she bought her goods from an overseas seller, or from a seller based in Australia? Polly decides to buy a computer from the local store. The computer comes with a warranty for one year. But just after the warranty expires, her computer fails.

Can she still expect the store to provide a remedy for the faulty computer, even though it's now after the 12 month warranty has expired?
