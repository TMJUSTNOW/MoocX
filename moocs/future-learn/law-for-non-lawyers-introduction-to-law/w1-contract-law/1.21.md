Michael’s pet dog is sick, so he takes the dog to his local veterinarian, Trish.

Trish tells Michael she can offer treatment that **might** cure his dog for $50, or she can fix the dog’s illness completely and restore it to good health for $1,000. Trish recommends the second option. Michael pays Trish the $1,000 and his dog is cured. When Michael gets home he feels anxious, as he couldn’t really afford to pay so much money to Trish. Can Michael ask for his money back, and why/why not?

Trish already cured Michael’s dog, meeting her obligation under their agreement.

No. Michael received two options and could easily have opted for the second one. Under the doctrine of freedom of contract, Michael and Trish can create any agreement they please.

Yes. As an expert in the area of treating animals, there is a power imbalance between Trish and Michael, which means he is more likely to do what she suggests he does than if she was, say, a neighbour or friend without veterinary training.

Maybe, depending upon whether Michael’s dog remains cured for at least one month after Trish treated it.
