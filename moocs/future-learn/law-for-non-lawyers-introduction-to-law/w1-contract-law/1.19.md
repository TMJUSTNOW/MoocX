# Law in your backyard

The “What’s the deal” case study explored statutory guarantees and their relationship with terms and conditions which you agree to. It’s now time for you to discover how the law applies in your jurisdiction.

## What you need to do

1. Choose an online retailer or website where you can make purchases.
2. Access their Terms of Service and identify the sections that relate to non-delivery of goods and available dispute mechanisms.
3. In the **Comments**, share with other learners your findings.

Does the online retailer provide you a solution to non-delivery, or are you only protected by your own consumer laws? Are your rights affected if the retailer is based within your jurisdiction or outside?
