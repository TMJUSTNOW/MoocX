# Reflect and connect

You’ve learned more about the way contract law operates and protects consumers. It’s now your turn to reflect and share your thoughts with other learners.

## Talking point

Within the **Discussion**, consider sharing with other learners your thoughts on the following questions:

- What’s the most surprising thing you found out about contract law from the case study and its analysis, and how has it changed the way you behave as a consumer, particularly if you’re shopping online?
- In your home country, do most people use written agreements or oral agreements?

Don’t forget to contribute to the discussion by reviewing comments made by other learners, making sure you provide constructive feedback and commentary. You can also ‘like’ comments or follow other learners throughout the course.
