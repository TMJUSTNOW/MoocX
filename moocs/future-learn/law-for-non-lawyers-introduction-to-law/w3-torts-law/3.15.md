# Check your understanding

Cautious Connie operates a bicycle shop. She reads in a monthly cycling magazine that there’s a new industry recommendation for attaching wheels to a bike. Connie has already assembled bikes that do not comply with the new recommendation.

Is Connie negligent if she fails to modify those bikes to the new recommendation and someone is injured as a direct result?

No, the standard of care is measured at the date of the alleged breach and connie didn’t know of the new recommendation when the bicycles were assembled.

Yes, if it was reasonably foreseeable and not overtly inconvenient that a failure to modify the bicycles to the new recommendation might cause harm, then you have arguably breached your duty of care.

No, a bicycle seller owes no duty to take reasonable care to the purchaser of their assembled bicycles.

Yes, Cautious Connie should have already assembled her bicycles to a high standard regardless of the recommendations and would be liable for any harm however the harm was caused.
