# Reflect and connect

You’ve explored the tort of negligence, duty of care and standard of care. It’s now your turn to reflect and share your thoughts with other learners.

## Talking point

Within the **Discussion**, consider sharing with other learners your thoughts on the following questions:

- What’s the most surprising thing you found out about torts law from the case study and its analysis?
- Have you ever had to sign a ‘waiver’ giving up your rights to seek compensation from someone or a business because you were about to do something that was inherently risky?

Don’t forget to contribute to the discussion by reviewing comments made by other learners, making sure you provide constructive feedback and commentary. You can also ‘like’ comments or follow other learners throughout the course.
