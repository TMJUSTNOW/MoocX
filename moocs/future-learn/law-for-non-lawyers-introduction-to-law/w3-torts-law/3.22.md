# The Friendly Memo gallery

The gallery showcases ‘Friendly Memos’ and guidance created by learners or anything else they’ve found that help others better understand the law.

This is an opportunity for you to now develop your text-based assignment from this week, and generate a more visually striking advisory for the benefit of your community. The format is up to you, but it could take the form of a poster, video, brochure or even links to a website or online campaign.

The gallery is curated by the lead educators and course mentors, and they’ll select a number of images that have been shared by learners with the **Law for Non-Lawyers - Friendly Memos** group on Flickr that best reflect the themes of the guidance in interesting ways. We hope the gallery inspires you to create and share your own guidance to help others better understand the law.

## Sharing your images on Flickr

If you’d like your Friendly Memo to be considered for the gallery, you’ll need to post it to the [Law for Non-Lawyers - Friendly Memos group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/3798520@N22/) on Flickr. If you haven’t already, you’ll need to register with Flickr. If you’re not sure how to do this, review [Signing in to Flickr](https://about.futurelearn.com/about/faq/social-media-tips/#flickrsignin) and [How to join a Flickr group](https://about.futurelearn.com/about/faq/social-media-tips/#flickrgroup).

**Don’t forget, if you are uploading your Friendly Memo to the Law for Non-Lawyers - Friendly Memos group on Flickr and would like it to be considered for the gallery, please specify the image viewing permissions to ‘Public’.**
