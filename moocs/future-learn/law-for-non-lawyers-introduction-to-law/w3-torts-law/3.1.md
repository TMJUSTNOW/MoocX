[0:04Skip to 0 minutes and 4 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/177754#)LLOYD ENGLAND: This week, torts law-- tortious liability is a private law system between person and person. There are many torts we're all exposed to, defamation, libel, slander, the tort of passing off one goods as someone else's-- even the tort of wrongful death. Specifically, we're going to look at the tort of negligence and the torts of trespass, trespass to person, goods, and land. What is your duty of care? Who do you owe it to? What standard of care must you act in order not to be tortiously liable to your neighbor for any damage you may cause? What can we do to not be negligent and how can we make the world a better place?

[0:45Skip to 0 minutes and 45 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/177754#)We'll be working with legal academics around two tortious scenarios to see how this plays out in everyday life. I bet by the end of the week, you will view your conduct, your acts and your admissions, through a legal lens of tortious liability and I bet your conduct raises in terms of the standard towards your neighbor. Let's get on with it and learn all about the world of torts.

Watch Lloyd (Justice of the Peace, Lecturer, Faculty of Law) introduce the topics that are going to be discussed throughout this week of the course.

Everyday, in our community, we all have a duty to take care with our acts and behaviours, and to avoid causing harm or injury to each other that we could just as easily avoid if we were careful.

‘Tort’ is an ancient French word, meaning a ‘twisted’ or ‘wrong’, so legally is a civil wrong. Tort claims are brought by individuals, known as plaintiffs, who have suffered harm or injury to either their: personal security and safety, reputation, property, as well as their economic and financial interests by other individuals, known as defendants, from what they do, or fail to do, either through their negligence, intention or simply doing something that causes the plaintiff harm.
