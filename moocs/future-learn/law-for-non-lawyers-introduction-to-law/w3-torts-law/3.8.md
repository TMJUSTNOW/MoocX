Jemma’s son Teddy is 7 years old. Over the school holidays, Teddy has been running around the house, knocking things over, screaming and carrying on and Jemma is tired of trying to control him. So she can get some time to herself to clean the family home, Jemma tells Teddy to go to his room. She then closes the door and locks it from the outside, so Teddy can’t get out. Is Jemma liable under tort law?

Yes. Jemma is clearly liable under the tort of false imprisonment, given she has intentionally ‘imprisoned’ Teddy.

Yes. Jemma was negligent in failing to control Teddy in the first place and her actions in locking him in his room only make her negligence more severe.

No. Jemma didn’t act in a way that was unlawful. She is entitled to exercise reasonable parental control over her child.

No, because Teddy didn’t actively protest being locked in his room, or try other means of escaping.
