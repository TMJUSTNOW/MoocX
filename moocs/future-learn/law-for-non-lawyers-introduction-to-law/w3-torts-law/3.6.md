# Law in your backyard

The “Tony Trespasser” case study explored different types of Torts including trespass to land, goods and the person. It’s now time for you to discover how the law applies in your jurisdiction.

## What you need to do

1. Go online and find the law related to Torts in your jurisdiction. If you live in Australia, consider finding out about the law from another State or common law jurisdiction.
2. In the **Comments**, share with other learners your findings.

In the case study, Tony placed the ceramic frog in the hand of the sleeping student. Does this raise any torts liability in your jurisdiction, even though the student wasn’t aware? Can you explain the law relating to battery?

If you’re not sure how to find law resources, watch Caroline’s [How to start finding the law](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/177718) and [How to access online law resources](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/177719) to learn how to access and search for legal information online.
