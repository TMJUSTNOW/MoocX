# The Ross Hyams Perspective

[0:04Skip to 0 minutes and 4 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/207444#)LLOYD ENGLAND: Are consumers always put on notice about intellectual property rights?

[0:09Skip to 0 minutes and 9 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/207444#)ROSS HYAMS: No. They're not. Because just because there's no little logo on it or a little copyright symbol doesn't mean that there's no ownership in the copyright. You have to be careful of that one. So you're not always put on notice.

[0:29Skip to 0 minutes and 29 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/207444#)ROSS HYAMS: Often, in the expression of ideas there are layers of rights. They can come in many different categories. So you have to do some homework, simple as that. You have to go out and do some homework. You have to find out what the situation is. And again, if you don't understand, go and see a lawyer and get some proper advice.

How important is it to read those terms of services when we engage with social media and put our works out there in the public domain?

[1:05Skip to 1 minute and 5 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/207444#)ROSS HYAMS: It's very important. You have to understand exactly what is being taken from you. If I put a photo of my dog on Facebook, for example, it's really important to read the terms of service to understand what rights you are giving away. It's my photo. But I'm putting it out there. I'm relinquishing my rights to that photo, to a certain extent. And I'm agreeing to the terms of service that Facebook has made me agree to. And it's out there. It's out there according to their terms of service. And if you don't understand it, then don't do it, simple as that.
