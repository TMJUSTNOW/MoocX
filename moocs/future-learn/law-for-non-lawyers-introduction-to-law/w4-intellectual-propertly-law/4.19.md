# End of course discussion

Congratulations, you’ve made your way through the course. It’s now your turn to reflect and then share with other learners your thoughts on your experience.

## Talking point

Please take some time now to think about the course as a whole. Within the **Discussion**, consider sharing with other learners what the most important things you have learned.

What are the gems for you from this course? Perhaps it is one of the things that were mentioned in a video or an assignment, or a comment from another learner or even a Friendly Memo.

You might like to take some time to read comments made by other learners, and if you find these comments interesting, respond to them. Remember you can also ‘like’ comments or follow other learners throughout the course.
