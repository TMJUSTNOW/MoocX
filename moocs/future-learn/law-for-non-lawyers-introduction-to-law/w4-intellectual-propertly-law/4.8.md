Mandy from Melbourne wanted to be a pop star, but she didn’t know how to write songs. Mandy looked online and found Con, who lives in Sydney, and who had recorded a song he wrote and posted it on his personal blog. Mandy recorded herself singing Con’s song and eventually a Hollywood producer offered her $1 million dollars for the rights to the song. Can Mandy sell the song and take the money for herself?

Yes. Mandy performed the song and Mandy attracted attention to the song, which might otherwise have gone unnoticed.

Yes. Con never formally declared or registered that the song was subject to copyright, so it was technically free for anyone to do what they wanted with.

No. Con owns the copyright in his song and he never gave Mandy permission to perform or publish it.

No, because Mandy first needs to obtain legal advice to make sure the deal with the Hollywood producer is fair for her.
