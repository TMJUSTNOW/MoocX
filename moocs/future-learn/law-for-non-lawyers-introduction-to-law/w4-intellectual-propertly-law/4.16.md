# Reflect and connect

You’ve explored intellectual property protection and commercial exploitation. It’s now your turn to reflect and share your thoughts with other learners.

## Talking point

Within the **Discussion**, consider sharing with other learners your thoughts on the following questions.

Do you share your photos or videos online via social media? If so, research what are the terms of use you have agreed to by using these services and find out what intellectual property rights you have either lost or retained by posting them up on your social media.

Don’t forget to contribute to the discussion by reviewing comments made by other learners, making sure you provide constructive feedback and commentary. You can also ‘like’ comments or follow other learners throughout the course.
