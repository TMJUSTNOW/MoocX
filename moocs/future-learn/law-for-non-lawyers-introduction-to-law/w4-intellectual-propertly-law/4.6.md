# Law in your backyard

The “Carl Copyright” case study explored copyright creation and infringement. It’s now time for you to discover how the law applies in your jurisdiction.

## What you need to do

1. Go online and find the law related to copyright in your jurisdiction. If you live in Australia, consider finding out about the law from **another**common law jurisdiction.
2. In the **Comments**, share with other learners your findings and responses to the following questions:

- What are the penalties for copyright infringement if you download a movie in your jurisdiction?
- Are there penalties and does it increase if you were to show the film in public?
- Is this a criminal or civil matter in your jurisdiction, and do think it’s appropriate to criminalise infringing intellectual property rights?
