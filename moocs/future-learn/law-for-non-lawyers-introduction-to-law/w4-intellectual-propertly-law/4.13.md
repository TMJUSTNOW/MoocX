# Law in your backyard

The “Inventive Irene” case study explored intellectual property protection and commercial exploitation of a product. It’s now time for you to discover how the law applies in your jurisdiction.

## What you need to do

Go online and find the law related to copyright, design protection, patents, trademarks and confidential information in your jurisdiction. If you live in Australia, consider finding out about the law from another common law jurisdiction.

In the **Comments**, share with other learners your findings.

If you invented a product and called it “Buzz Off”, are you able to register this trademark for an insect repelling device in your jurisdiction?

How much does it cost to register a design under your registered design system? Is your jurisdiction a signatory to Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)?

Does the same trademark system allow you to register colour and smells in your jurisdiction?

If you’re not sure how to find law resources, watch Caroline’s [How to start finding the law](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/177718) and [How to access online law resources](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/177719) to learn how to access and search for legal information online.
