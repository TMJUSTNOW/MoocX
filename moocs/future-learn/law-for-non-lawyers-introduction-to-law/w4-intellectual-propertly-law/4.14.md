# The Ross Hyams Perspective

[0:04Skip to 0 minutes and 4 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/207447#)LLOYD ENGLAND: Why do we have intellectual property rights? And what is it they're trying to achieve?

[0:08Skip to 0 minutes and 8 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/207447#)ROSS HYAMS: Intellectual property rights really exist to incentivise commercial life and to incentivise people to be motivated to put their ideas out there and to hold onto them so they can get some value out of them as well.

[0:22Skip to 0 minutes and 22 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/207447#)LLOYD ENGLAND: So why is it really important to protect your ideas and inventions when you try and go out to market to commercially realise them?

[0:29Skip to 0 minutes and 29 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/207447#)ROSS HYAMS: So let's say you invented a gadget, for example. You go talk to a lawyer about how you might commercialise it, and the lawyer will be bound by confidentiality, so that's not going to go out anywhere. But let's say you wanted to talk to somebody who's going to mass produce your invention. You want to talk to them about this, but you don't want them to tell anybody else, because you want to hold onto it. So you'd sign a non-disclosure agreement with them. You'd be protected, and they wouldn't be able to tell anybody else about it while you were sort of working this idea or this invention up a bit.

[1:04Skip to 1 minute and 4 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/law-for-non-lawyers/3/steps/207447#)ROSS HYAMS: I think it really comes down to understanding your rights, understanding your obligations, being up to date, and don't get into things without getting advice. If you are getting into serious territory, get advice. Don't try and do it yourself.
