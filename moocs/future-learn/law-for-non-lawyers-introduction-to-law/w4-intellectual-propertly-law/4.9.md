# Reflect and connect

You’ve explored areas of copyright creation and infringement in intellectual property law. It’s now your turn to reflect and share your thoughts with other learners.

## Talking point

Within the **Discussion**, consider sharing with other learners your thoughts on the following questions:

- Have you ever had to seek the consent of an original author of copyright material for professional use in work or business? Was this an easy thing to do, or was it hard to find the original author?
- If you haven’t sought consent from an original author of copyright material, how would you go about it in your jurisdiction?

Don’t forget to contribute to the discussion by reviewing comments made by other learners, making sure you provide constructive feedback and commentary. You can also ‘like’ comments or follow other learners throughout the course.
