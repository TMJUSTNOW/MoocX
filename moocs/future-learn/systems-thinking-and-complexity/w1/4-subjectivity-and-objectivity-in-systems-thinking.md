# Subjectivity and objectivity in systems thinking

An interesting and important question in systems thinking is whether social systems exist in an objective way or whether they are subjective constructs.

Consider a social situation you know well. For example, it might be a family gathering, a meeting at work, or even the Brexit vote. Do you think everybody involved saw the situation in an objective way? Did you?

To investigate the subjective-objective perspectives question, you are invited to participate in an experiment. The following anonymous questionnaire will take about five minutes to complete and does not count towards your score on the course. You will be asked which country you live in, whether you think in five years most British citizens will have higher incomes as a result of the Brexit, whether gold is worth more money than silver, whether the climate system is changing, whether the environment will be better as a result of Donald Trump’s climate change policy, and if the balls in a given image are the same size. If required, you will be able to answer that you are unsure.

When you have finished and submitted your answers, click on ‘Back to course’ in the top left of the window.

The results of this quiz will be published next week.

What do you think? Is it possible for people to be **objective** when describing systems? Do you have examples of subjectivity and objectivity? Give your views and examples in the discussion.
