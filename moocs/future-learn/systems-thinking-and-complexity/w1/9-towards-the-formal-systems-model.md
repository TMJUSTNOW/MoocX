The image above is an illustration of the Formal Systems Model. We will work towards defining this model in the rest of the steps this week.

### Building a Formal Systems Model

This begins with *system maps*, which are drawn to show the structure of a system.

System maps are followed by *influence diagrams*, which represent the main structural features of a system and the important influences that exist among them.

*Multiple cause diagrams* are used to explore why changes or events happen in systems. They can give insights into the multiple causes of system behaviour and how to make undesirable behaviour less likely. *Sign graphs* provide a refinement of multiple cause diagrams.

Each of these will be considered as the building blocks for the Formal Systems Model shown above.
