# Can we be objective when analysing systems?

In the last step you were asked the questions:

- which country do you live in?
- do you think in five years most British citizens will have higher incomes as a result of the Brexit?
- is gold worth more money than silver?
- do you think that the climate system is changing?

On Monday, 12th June 2017, we will publish the results of the questionnaire.
