# Conclusion to Week 1

At the end of Week 1 you have been introduced to some of the basic ideas of systems thinking and some of the techniques for drawing systems diagrams. These include:

- parts, wholes, and holism
- systems, their boundaries and their environments
- subjectivity and objectivity in describing social systems
- feedback and control
- system maps and influence diagrams
- multiple cause and sign diagrams
- bed blocking as a systems problem
- using systems thinking to seek solutions to systemic problems

We hope you found this week interesting and, if you are new to these ideas, find systems thinking natural and insightful.
