Systems are formed from sets of interacting parts where every part effects and is effected by every other part, and the behaviour of the system emerges from the interactions. On this course a system is defined as follows

1. an assembly of components, connected together in an organised way
2. the components are affected by being in the system and the behaviour of the systems is changed if they leave it
3. the organised assembly of components does something
4. the assembly has been identified as being of particular interest.

The last of these emphasises the use of systems thinking for designing and managing systems, avoiding or mitigating failure, and improving performance – no matter how simple or complex the system may be.

Many systems have a purpose – the organised assembly of components does something useful. The video gives the example of train system transporting people and goods, hospitals looking after unwell people, and farming providing food.

Sometimes systems go wrong because they have systemic weaknesses. This course will show how systems and complexity thinking can help diagnose, prevent or mitigate such failures. Sometimes systems could be improved to give better performance and outcomes, and systems thinking helps to identify those parts of the system or behaviours where improvements are possible.

### Prove what you’ve learned with a certificate

If you want a record of your course, you can [upgrade your course](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/systems-thinking-complexity/3/upgrade) for a Certificate of Achievement when you are eligible.

The Certificate of Achievement is a great way to prove what you have learned on the course and is evidence of your Continuing Professional Development. This is a personalised certificate and transcript, detailing the syllabus and learning outcomes from the course. It comes as a printed certificate as well as a digital version which you can add to your LinkedIn profile. To qualify, you must have marked at least 90% of the steps in the course complete.

Upgrading will also give you **unlimited access to the course**. You can go at your own pace and return to the material whenever you like, with access to the course for as long as it exists on FutureLearn.

What is a system? Systems are formed from sets of interacting parts. Every part effects, and is effected by, every other part. The behaviour of the system emerges from these interactions.

Many systems have a purpose. They do something useful. The hospital system looks after unwell people. The train system transports people and goods. The farming system provides food. But sometimes systems go wrong. Systems thinking can help in preventing or mitigating failures. Systems have subsystems. But combining successful parts does not always create a successful whole. For example, in 1998, Daimler, manufacturer of Mercedes Benz vehicles merged with US vehicle maker Chrysler. But this wasn’t successful nine years later DaimlerChrysler sold a majority stake in Chrysler losing billions of dollars. One reason for this is that Daimler’s executives didn’t pay enough attention to the cultural differences between the companies.

One of the challenging aspects of a system is knowing where the boundary is with its environment. Sometimes this depends on your point of view. For example, The Open University specialises in distance education, and teaches using the internet. Is the internet part of the Open University system? Or part of the environment? Systems thinking provides methods for deciding what is in a system, and what is in its environment. Very often this depends on the purpose of the system. Feedback is important in systems thinking, and a lack of it is often a cause of system failure. For example, citizens may feel alienated from their country’s political system because they feel their concerns are not feeding back into policy.

Systems thinking gives the big picture. Just knowing its fundamental principles can help solve problems and avoid systemic failures. Systems thinking can help us design and manage systems more successfully. Even so, some systems are hard to predict and manage. For example, stock markets may suddenly change. And a flu epidemic may spread unpredictably. The science of complex systems helps to understand why this is and what can be done. This new science extends systems thinking by adding new theory, new computational methods, and new forms of data.

On this course a system will be defined as This course will show how systems thinking can be used for designing and managing systems and avoiding or mitigating failure – no matter how simple or complex the system may be.
