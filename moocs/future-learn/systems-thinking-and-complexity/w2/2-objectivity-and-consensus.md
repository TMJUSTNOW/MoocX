Last week you were asked a number of questions. Here are your results:

The purpose of this questionnaire was to investigate if we all see the world in the same way. It seems that many of us see some things differently to others but we have a strong consensus on some things.

What are the implications of this for when we try to apply systems thinking? Could these results be considered to be evidence that we see things differently. Or was the process flawed in some way?

Do you think that groups of people working together to analysis a system might be able to form a consensus. Would such a consensus be in any way less subjective? What do you think?
