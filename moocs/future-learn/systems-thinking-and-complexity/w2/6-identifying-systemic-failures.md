# Identifying systemic failures

View this video are try to answer the following questions:

- What was the purpose or mission of this system?
- Was the decision-making subsystem effective?
- Were adequate resources made available?
- Were the components appropriately connected within this system?

The first of these questions is easy to answer. The purpose of the system, or those parts of it than can be inferred from on the video, was to counter terrorist activity and keep the public safe. In this case the system failed with a tragic loss of life. However this must be put in context. Many countries are subject to terrorist attacks that cost many innocent lives. On a day to day basis, the authorities in the UK achieve the purpose of keeping the public safe, and failures are rare.

Now think about the remaining three questions and then see what other participants have posted. Try to justify your answers with things you have learned on the course. You are also encouraged to discuss your answers with others.
