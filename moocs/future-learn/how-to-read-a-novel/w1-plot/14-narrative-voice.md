## Narrative voice

Having considered some of the ways in which this novel plays around with time, this step will focus on narration – on the question of who is telling the story, and what effect this has on our perception of events.

When it comes to narrative voice, *The Sport of Kings* is particularly rich in the variety of perspectives we’re given. In some sections the narrator is in the first person (that is, events are told from the viewpoint of one of the characters), and in others we have a third-person voice – somehow “above” the story, and therefore likely to be less partial. In other sections we are presented with an inclusive second-person voice: this feels as though the narrator is talking to himself, reflecting on his own experience, but also attempting to bring the reader into the subject position of the narrative:

> They say there’s gonna be a black president someday. Maybe. Or maybe just black skin. Either way, you won’t ever get to vote in Kentucky. Won’t have a place to live, ’cause you won’t qualify for Section Eight housing to get your feet on the ground, won’t ever serve on a jury to keep a brother out of jail, won’t ever get a good job once you X the little felony box, can’t legally carry a gun to keep some crazy racist from killing you, and there was never any protection against the cops to begin with.

> Men like Forge can get away with anything. But you? It’s over – no money, no life, no hope. But that was always in the script, wasn’t it? That’s how they wrote it. If anyone has eyes, they can read it. It’s written in black blood on white paper.

> No matter the crime, they sentence every single one of you to death.

The effect of that “you” voice is to signal that the events in Allmon’s life are representative, pertaining to the shared experience of a particular race and class. But this is just one section, and the variety of different narrative perspectives throughout the novel suggests that there isn’t just one overall narrator telling the story. There is no stable point of rest, so that individual stories, whether objectively accurate or not, seem to be valorised over a more authoritative overview of events.

The author also makes frequent use of free indirect style in order to communicate a character’s perspective. Let’s just remind ourselves briefly: free indirect style is third-person narration which is modified by the thoughts or linguistic register of a particular character.

It would be possible to pick out dozens of instances of this in the novel, but let’s confine ourselves to just one for now. This occurs very near the start of the novel. Here the young Henry Forge, just nine years old at this point, is accused by his father of killing a bull from a neighbouring farm. Having tracked him down, John Henry ties him to an old whipping post:

> The scotched and furrowed pole had stood for more years than the boy could count. It was half as tall and nearly as thick as a man, long debarked and burnished by the years, its length seasoned by tears and blood and weather, but oh what did it matter, he was strapped like a pig to a spit, but he didn’t do it, he didn’t go onto the Miller property . . .

Notice there how the voice shifts from the perspective of the narrator describing the pole, to Henry’s own despairing thoughts: “oh what did it matter”; his bitter description of himself as “strapped like a pig to a spit”; and his final insistent denial that “he didn’t do it”. These are Henry’s unspoken thoughts on his plight, rendered in his own mode of expression, but still presented in the third person, and in the past tense.
