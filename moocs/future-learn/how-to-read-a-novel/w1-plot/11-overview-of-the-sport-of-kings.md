## Overview of The Sport of Kings

In the previous steps we looked at some of the ways in which authors structure their novels in order to play around with time; we also considered issues relating to narration, such as “frames” and free indirect style. We’re now going to apply our understanding of these devices to a contemporary novel – C. E. Morgan’s 2016 *The Sport of Kings*.

Put briefly, the novel focuses on the wealthy and dynastic Forge family, and particularly Henry Forge and his daughter Henrietta. After inheriting his father’s Kentucky estate, and very much against his father’s wishes, Henry turns the arable land into a horse farm for breeding racehorses. A central plot strand concerns Henry’s ambition to breed the perfect racehorse, and themes such as ancestry and “pure” bloodlines are very prominent: Henry’s father, the tyrannical John Henry Forge, could trace the family’s presence in Kentucky back to the white settlers who made it through the Cumberland Gap after the Revolutionary War.

The novel is also, therefore, very much about race, and a second strand of the plot focuses on Allmon Shaughnessy, who is mixed-race, and has endured a tough childhood and adolescence before ending up as a groom on Forge Run Farm. His own ancestry can be traced back to a runaway slave, Scipio, and several of the novel’s brief “interludes”, positioned between much longer chapters set closer to the present day, concern Scipio’s escape and its long-term aftermath.

As that short overview might have signalled, the novel’s structure is not linear; it shifts backwards and forwards through time as family histories are filled in and personal memories are recalled. So if we were to trace the story from A to B, this would require a complete reordering of the chapters. But even within each of the chapters, there are notable examples of flashbacks and flash-forwards, deceleration and acceleration, as well as “descriptive pauses”, whereby the plot is suspended altogether for a moment of pure description. Over the next few steps we’ll consider Morgan’s handling of some of these effects, and consider what the impact of these might be.
