This week we’ve covered a range of issues regarding the presentation of conversations in fictional narrative.

- We have considered what is revealed by the way a character talks and interacts in conversation.
- And we’ve looked closely at the various effects of introducing dialect voices into a novel.
- Finally, we’ve considered a range of examples of dialogue from Eimear McBride’s *The Lesser Bohemians*, and considered some of the effects generated.

Next week, we’ll be turning to the issue of setting, and considering why authors might choose particular locations for their novels. We’ll also be looking at a range of examples from Jo Baker’s novel *A Country Road, A Tree*.
