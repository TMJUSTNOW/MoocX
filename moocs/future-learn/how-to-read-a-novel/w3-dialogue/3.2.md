# Reading between the lines: what does dialogue reveal to us about the characters?

Here Alex Lawrie explains how careful reading of fictional conversations can tell us a great deal about the characters involved. She also demonstrates that if we donâ€™t follow some conversations carefully, we might miss some subtle moments of tension.

[0:09Skip to 0 minutes and 9 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185672#)The most conventional way we encounter dialogue in a novel is when each new line of speech by a different character is given a new line on the page. The narrator might occasionally step in with, "She said" or, "He mumbled", or the conversation may be allowed to continue unimpeded. There tends to be little doubt as to who is speaking, so we as readers feel as though we are standing on the sidelines, witnesses to a real conversation. Consider the following exchange early on in Jane Austen's 1817 novel, Northanger Abbey, when the novel's heroine, Catherine Morland, first meets her future husband, Henry Tilney, in Bath.

'My journal!' 'Yes; I know exactly what you will say: Friday, went to the Lower Rooms; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings - plain black shoes - appeared to much advantage, but was strangely harassed by a queer half-witted man, who would make me dance with him, and distressed me by his nonsense.' 'Indeed I shall say no such thing.' 'Shall I tell you what you ought to say?' 'If you please.' 'I danced with a very agreeable young man, introduced by Mr.

[1:18Skip to 1 minute and 18 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185672#)King; had a great deal of conversation with him - seems a most extraordinary genius - hope I may know more of him. That, madam, is what I wish you to say.'" But this conversation is also useful for what it reveals about the characters at this stage of the novel. Henry is amusing and flirtatious and gently teases Catherine. The two are clearly enjoying this lighthearted exchange, which carries on for much longer than this excerpt. And they seem attracted to each other. With most authors, and certainly here with Austen, the point is to create a scene in which the conversation feels entirely natural. But of course it never is.

[1:55Skip to 1 minute and 55 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185672#)The lines of dialogue are carefully placed, and there are rarely any of those hesitations or stumbling words, the ums and ers that we get in real life. While some authors will offer clues as to how a line of dialogue is said - i.e. "She murmured sarcastically", "He shouted" - others will leave it to the reader to infer the tone in which the words are uttered. In the passage just quoted, for instance, we are expected to realise that Henry is not really speaking that first line in a grave manner. And we supposed to realise that the tone is light and playful, without ever being told so.

[2:30Skip to 2 minutes and 30 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185672#)So, when the narrator takes a back seat, the onus is placed on us to gauge the mood of the conversation. There are sometimes moments where, if we don't read carefully, we might miss out some subtle moments of tension, or a misunderstanding that's taking place as a result of characters speaking at cross purposes. In another novel by Austen, Emma, which I've referred to in earlier weeks, a misunderstanding takes place when the title character believes that her young friend and protege, Harriet Smith, is confessing to Emma her affection for Frank Churchill, a love match Emma would approve of. When, in fact, Harriet is declaring her feelings for another character, Mr. Knightley, who Emma will later marry, and whom Harriet feels inferior to.

[3:13Skip to 3 minutes and 13 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185672#)Because the man in question is not named, and either of them would match the description, the women have a conversation about two very different people without realising it. Emma leads us off here.

[3:27Skip to 3 minutes and 27 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185672#)"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly superior in situation to think of you. Is it not so?' 'Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose - Indeed I am not so mad - But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance - and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so proper, in me especially.' 'I am not at all surprised at you, Harriet.

[4:04Skip to 4 minutes and 4 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185672#)The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart.' 'Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation! - The very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time - when I saw him coming - his noble look - and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In one moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness.' 'It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable - Yes, honourable, I think, to choose so well and so gratefully.'" There are several moments of subtle humour in this passage. Emma's supreme confidence that she has caught Harriet's meaning - "I will not affect to be in doubt of it", "I am not at all surprised."

[4:43Skip to 4 minutes and 43 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185672#)And of course, her approving response to Harriet's choice, which will later turn to horror when she grasps his true identity.
