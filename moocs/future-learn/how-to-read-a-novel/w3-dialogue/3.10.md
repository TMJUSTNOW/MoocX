# Dialogue and descriptive commentary[** View541 comments](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185528#fl-comments)

Let’s now look at an example of an exchange which includes also thoughts and descriptive commentary. This is from near the start of the novel, when Eily spots Stephen at the theatre and is horrified to realise he is coming over to talk to her:

There are several things to note in this passage. Firstly, the writing in that slightly smaller font. These are Eily’s unspoken directives to herself while she attempts to act composed and aloof: “pray for poise” and “don’t buy an ice cream like a child.” Notice also those blanks left between words to signal an awkward pause in the conversation.

And as in previous examples, the words aren’t always assigned to a speaker (and are not placed in quotation marks), so it is for the reader to deduce who is talking each time. The dialogue and Eily’s narrative commentary (or her description of what is happening) also run alongside each other: there is nothing separating the actual spoken words, her thoughts, and her report of their body language. For instance: the sentence “Please poise at my step” contains Eily’s entreaty to herself (those first two words in the smaller font) followed by a description of where Stephen is now standing.

At the level of sentence structure, this passage (and McBride’s prose more generally) is rich in the variety of unconventional techniques it uses to present dialogue.

But it does much more than that, though, because Eily’s personality is also inscribed in this excerpt: along with her inward pleas for “poise”, the sentence “Hello, I thought it was you, he says and I remember and I remember and make some word like Hi” shows her pretending not to recall where she knows him from, in a bid to come across as cool and indifferent.

Note also the awkward scrabble for words after the phrase “it’s just my first time” – this is a reference to the theatre, but she quickly realises this can refer also to sex, and to her losing her virginity to him, and she thinks she sees him smile as he makes the same connection. She affects to study her programme in order to get rid of him, but inwardly she feels “shame sealed” and desperately tries to “stick on that nonchalant smile” as he walks away.

And finally, consider those last few sentences when she sees him talking to another woman: “And so what of it? What do I care? I am here for the Art”. These thoughts are an attempt to brush aside her feelings for him, to convince herself that her mind remains on culture, rather than sex.
