# Introduction to dialogue

This week, we’re focusing on dialogue, and on what this reveals about character.

- We will consider the various ways in which conversations are rendered in fictional narrative.
- We will also consider how much is revealed by how a character talks and interacts in conversation.
- We’ll look at the effects of introducing dialect voices into a novel.
- And you will be provided with pertinent examples of dialogue from Eimear McBride’s novel *The Lesser Bohemians*, to think about what impact this has on plot and characterisation.

But first, in this video Dr Alex Lawrie introduces us to some of the techniques used for presenting dialogue which we’ll be exploring in more depth.

As in life, this tends to play an important role, and we discussed in the previous week that it's also a good indicator of the type of person they are. They're likely to reveal a lot about themselves. How they are in conversation might hint at their mood. Are they angry, sad, happy, drunk? It might also reveal those aspects of their personality discussed in the previous week. Is this a patient person, quick-witted, arrogant, kind? And going beyond that, the way a character speaks is also likely to give us clues about their background and social status. Class, education, nationality, even, and age.

It's one of the main ways we judge character. This section will introduce you to some of the techniques used for presenting dialogue and highlighting some of the effects produced.
