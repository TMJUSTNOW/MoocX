# Introduction to dialect[** View585 comments](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185509#fl-comments)

As discussed in the previous activity, dialogue, or the way a person conducts him or herself in conversation, can reveal a lot about a character – just as we tend to make assumptions based on how we hear a person speaking in our day-to-day lives.

If they stumble over their words a lot, or get things wrong, we might imagine them to be nervous, lacking confidence, or simply not know what they’re talking about. On the other hand someone who can interact calmly and politely will almost always make a good impression.

But this issue of voice, or discourse, becomes particularly pertinent when we are presented with characters speaking in dialect, or non-standard English. This can have several effects: firstly, it invests the novel or passage with an extra level of realism: most people will speak with some type of accent or inflection, so by presenting this on the page, the author is ensuring his or her characters sound more lifelike.

Although we associate this with authors such as Irvine Welsh and James Kelman, whose novels are filled with characters speaking in raw and abrasive Scots dialect rendered phonetically, this practice actually goes at least as far back as Sir Walter Scott, in the early nineteenth century.
