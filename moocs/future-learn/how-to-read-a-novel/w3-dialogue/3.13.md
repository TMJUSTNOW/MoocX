Watch an interview with Eimear McBride where she reflects on her experience of writing the novel. She talks about the importance of interiority, and how she approaches dialogue, characterisation, and setting.

If you are short of time, we’ve recommended a few highlights:

McBride tells us that the section of the novel in which Stephen confides to Eily about his past was partly inspired by the “Stavrogin’s Confession” section of [Dostoyevsky’s *The Devils*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demons_(Dostoyevsky_novel)) (you can read a [translation of “Stavrogin’s Confession” by Virginia Woolf here](http://dbanach.com/Woolf-Stavrogin.pdf)). McBride explains that she was interested in the idea of a separate, embedded story within the broader narrative:

> (12:43) Firstly, the idea of it really came from my interest in Dostoyevsky’s *The Devils*. And I was always very interested by the appendix, which is Stavrogin’s confession. So the whole novel, for those who haven’t read it, it’s a big political, hefty narrative about these conspirators. And Stavrogin is their leader. And he’s very dark, charismatic. But it’s not particularly personal. However, Dostoyevsky, the novelist brain clearly couldn’t leave it alone, and went away and wrote this long, long section called “Stavrogin’s Confession”, in which he confessed - he talks about how he raped an 11-year-old girl, who later took her own life. And when the book was first published, he was persuaded to remove it. So it was published without the confession. And it was only in the ’20s when it was found amongst, I think, his wife’s papers, that it was restored. And even now, it’s still printed just at the end of the book. But I was always very interested in the idea of a novel that has another story in it. And I do love nineteenth-century novels, and I love, especially, the great Russian - let’s sit down, I’ll tell you my whole life story. I always really enjoyed those kind of books, and I wanted to see if I could do that. **But this idea of having this whole section that is incredibly personal, which really changes how you view the character, but it also exists almost in isolation - so if you took it out, and you didn’t ever read it and you didn’t get it - would the novel be very different?**

McBride also uses this section of the novel to talk about the way that she uses dialogue:

> (16:43) It was very interesting linguistically, to think very carefully about. Of course, you could go into lots of very graphic descriptions of things, but **realistically, how much does someone really tell when they tell even the worst things that have happened to them or that they’ve done?** How much detail do they really give? And I often get annoyed by books that - someone is telling someone something, and there’s lots of this amazingly gratuitous detail, either sexual or violent. And I just think, no one would ever say that. No one would ever describe this experience in this way to another human being, especially sexual experiences. You could say to someone, well, I slept with so-and-so, but you wouldn’t give them a blow-by-blow account of what you did with them in bed.

When talking about the novel’s two main characters, Eily and Stephen, McBride emphasises the importance of performance and theatricality in thinking about the difference between an individual’s inner and outer selves:

> (21:19) The fact that she’s a student and he’s already quite a successful actor, was part of that mirroring again. But it was, I think using actors, it was interesting because **I think the outer and the inner are often quite different. And people can project this very easy-going, approachable exterior, but the inner life can be something that’s much more in turmoil.** So an actor seemed to be a perfect vehicle for that. And that’s very much who he is. And she’s still, she’s still very - her inner and outer are still very connected at this point in her life, but his are very separate but become more connected as he goes along. So I think there was that, and also just the idea of the performance of the self. Because it’s not something that she’s learned, but it’s something that he has down to a T, to such an extent that he’s sort of trapped behind this image of himself as tall, dark, handsome, sexually promiscuous. And again, his - that section I call “The Long Night,” which is when he tells his story, is about her viewing under the lid of that, especially that male performance of the self, that she starts to see underneath it.

And, finally, when talking about the ending, McBride tells us here that *The Lesser Bohemians* is the first book in a trilogy:

> (24:38) I knew how it would end for quite a long time. Before I knew how to get there, I knew what it would be. Because I think in a way, it felt almost like the most transgressive thing I could do. Because this is definitely a relationship that anyone seeing it on paper would just go - oh God, girl, run! Don’t go near that one! - And I just, I wanted to have a go with that cliche and try and pull away as much of it as possible and just look at people. And of course, people do things that are messy all the time, when they choose happiness. That’s all - because the thing is, they’re standing on top of Primrose Hill looking down at London, it’s a lovely day. But you know that the next day, he’s probably going to have to tell his daughter who’s a year younger, that he’s with this girl. And what’s she going to do next? And how’s it going to affect her studies, and all of these things. It’s going to be complicated. **But also, The Lesser Bohemians is the first book in a trilogy**.

How important is the “realism” of dialogue to you when you are reading a novel? McBride has [written elsewhere about the depiction of sex in literature](http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/eimear-mcbride-problems-erotica/) - do you think that there is a “politics” of writing about sex, in the same way that there is a “politics of dialect” (as we looked at in 3.7)?

[0:07Skip to 0 minutes and 7 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: What I want to start off by talking about is the style of the novel, which is obviously the most striking thing about it. Now, it's written in what I would describe - and I'd like to hear your views on this, obviously - as kind of stream of consciousness, with a dialogue with Ellie's thoughts and her own narrative commentary all kind of pushed together in the same sentence, blurred in that way. Is that how you would describe it?

[0:30Skip to 0 minutes and 30 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Yeah, I think it's more like a stream of existence than of consciousness, because it's not really just about the mind. It's very much about the body and senses and all of that going along with the mind as well. But it's absolutely about trying to keep the reader locked in the moment, in the present.

[0:49Skip to 0 minutes and 49 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: What is it that you feel is most effective - why did you choose that style?

[0:54Skip to 0 minutes and 54 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Because I'm interested in immediacy, to place the reader in very intensive intimacy with the characters. And so it's really - with A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing, it was about putting the reader inside the moment of trauma. With The Lesser Bohemians, it's about something much wider.

[1:18Skip to 1 minute and 18 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Do you think this is the most effective - well, is it partly because it's saturated in sex, much of it? Do you feel that there's a way in which language shatters at the right moment then, and therefore that kind of style is most effective for writing these scenes about sex?

[1:35Skip to 1 minute and 35 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Well, I think what was important writing the scenes about sex was that it was, at all times, very specific to the two people involved. And there's such a wealth of cliche when it comes to writing about sex, and even to the very limited vocabulary that's available to describe sex. And so it was trying to avoid that in order to really examine - be able to examine these people's characters, to examine their humanity, really, through the sexual lens.

[2:10Skip to 2 minutes and 10 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)And so I forbid myself all the usual cliched language. And then breaking the language around all of that seemed to be a way to invite the reader closer to the experience and to make it very much about them, not just generally two people having sex in a bedsit in 1994, but these two people, and what's going on between them each time they have sex.

[2:35Skip to 2 minutes and 35 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: So there's a sense in which we need to get right into their heads in order to get their own, well, obviously, their subjective experience of it.

[2:42Skip to 2 minutes and 42 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Yeah, absolutely. I really - the whole point of the sex is it's about character, and it's about what can we understand about these people in these moments. What do they reveal of themselves? And - so language works in a different way when you're trying to write the experience of the body rather than looking at the body, but actually from inside the body, as it is experiencing it.

[3:10Skip to 3 minutes and 10 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Is interiority for you the most important thing? That's obviously a modernist concern - you've written in the past about how you feel, not indebted to it, but part of that modernist tradition, in a way. So is interiority really the thing for you, to focus on?

[3:24Skip to 3 minutes and 24 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: For me, it is; it's what's most interesting in writing. It's really trying to explore the human, trying to explore the life under the skin. And so developing this new way of writing seems to sit very well with that. It allows people to have their own barriers broken down and the story to affect them in a deeper way.

[3:56Skip to 3 minutes and 56 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: There are quite a lot of moments in the novel when it's Stephen and Eily talking, or maybe a third character as well. I'm thinking of one particular moment when she comes back from, I think, having, gone to the loo or something - comes back to the pub, and Steven is talking to another woman. And so what you've got there is three characters, obviously talking. But there's no - obviously by this stage we're used to it - but there's no sense of who's talking, really. You don't give any of those usual attributions or signifiers of who's talking. But it's still straightforward, I think, to work out who is talking.

[4:27Skip to 4 minutes and 27 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)How hard did you find to write that, that so much must be in the dialogue? How difficult was that to do?

[4:35Skip to 4 minutes and 35 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Yeah, it was hard. And it was something that I went back to a lot. But essentially, I think the reader doesn't find it too difficult. Once they're accustomed to the idea that they're going to have to work out who's speaking, I don't think they do find it particularly hard, because Eily knows who's talking, and the reader is with her. They are in her. They're looking at life through her eyes and reacting to it with her body. So as long as I was very clear that she knew what was going on, I knew that the reader would be able to follow her.

[5:10Skip to 5 minutes and 10 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: How easy did you find it to find her voice? Because obviously, she's a central consciousness. Was she there first, and the others came in later? Was she always going to be the kind of conduit, as it were, for what's going on?

[5:27Skip to 5 minutes and 27 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Yes, she was. She was really the beginning of the book.

[5:32Skip to 5 minutes and 32 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)But in the earlier draft, she was quite a different character. And in some ways, she was much more like the character in The Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing. And it was only after a number of drafts that I realised it wouldn't work, because that character was incapable of connecting to the world. And Eily absolutely does, that's the whole point, is her eagerness to be in touch with life. And so that's when she suddenly became much more naive, I think, and much more inexperienced and shy, but also willing herself to overcome all the time.

[6:14Skip to 6 minutes and 14 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: So would you describe her as naive, then? Because I feel she quickly becomes very savvy. And her voice is kind of - it's funny, it's sympathetic. It's also sharp and quick.

[6:26Skip to 6 minutes and 26 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: I think she is naive, but I think there's often a problem with - and I think young women especially face this - if they are naive, that people mistake naivety for stupidity. And just because she's not streetwise doesn't mean that she isn't intelligent. And I think she's an incredibly bright girl, but she doesn't know the ways of the big city. And so those two things don't contradict each other at all. And she's open, and she's observant, and she's willing to be affected by what happens. And all of that means that, of course, she does acquire much more knowledge. But she retains a very sincere heart, I think.

[7:13Skip to 7 minutes and 13 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Yeah, absolutely, yeah. And there is a sense in which she's kind of drastically open to experiences. She comes here, and it's almost - OK, what can you throw at me, because I'm eager to learn, and I'm eager to, I know I'm in this brand new city for me, so I want to grow up really, really fast. So there is that sense in which she's remarkably open to new experiences, I think.

[7:33Skip to 7 minutes and 33 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Yeah, absolutely. And for me, it was very interesting to write about that experience of coming to the big city. Having done that myself as a young woman, I wanted to capture that, that thrill. Anyone who's ever left a small town for any big city anywhere in the world knows what that's like, the arriving in this new place and the wallop of experience, and trying to catch up with life and work out what it is that you like and what it is that you want, and first, just trying everything, because you have no idea what it is you want, and then those choices also informing the person that you are becoming and the next choice that you make.

[8:15Skip to 8 minutes and 15 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)And that was a lot of fun, actually, to write that.

[8:19Skip to 8 minutes and 19 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: How important is London here as setting? Because you describe it as a love letter to London. Or it's been described, I can't remember if it's in the novel or not. But it's also a very specific part of London. It's north-west London - Camden Town and all the rest of it. How important was it that it was London there?

[8:32Skip to 8 minutes and 32 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Oh, vital. Vital. And even before Eily, it was writing about London that got the novel going in the first place. I had just left London after having lived there for thirteen years, and I was very homesick for it. And I started to think about it and think about the London that I known, which was Camden Town in 1994 when I arrived. And so I started to write about that. And I just became very interested in seeing if it was possible to recapture those places and those - just the whole atmosphere of the place, and the thrill of it, and the race of it.

[9:09Skip to 9 minutes and 9 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)And also, it was about moving on from A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing where nothing was specific. Nothing was named. There were no dates. There were no places. It's just somewhere in Ireland at some point in the last twenty, thirty years. And this was really about nailing place, and writing about place for the first time. I really wanted to do that. And it seemed very important to me that I tried to recreate this very particular place in this very particular time.

[9:48Skip to 9 minutes and 48 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)And it was important for the story because it feeds into so much about her character. And also about Stephen's later on, because he has also been new to London once, although twenty years before her. And it's also a connection that they have about these two people who are on the outside, but wash up in the one place in the world that accepts outsiders.

[10:15Skip to 10 minutes and 15 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Yeah, absolutely. Was it about pinning down - because a lot of it, we know where it is because you pin down specific streets and areas, Hampstead Heath and all the rest of it. Was that an intention? You wanted to be very, very specific about the time? First of all, we have the three terms, so we know exactly where we are. You can pin it down month by month. But also, was it all about getting the detail of the place as well? Was that was crucial to you? It's not just London in 1994 or whatever? It's this specific street I want to be on?

[10:46Skip to 10 minutes and 46 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Yes. And that was, again for me, it was about the imaginative journey I wanted to take with the book. I think with Joyce's Ulysses, he famously said if it was destroyed, it could be rebuilt, brick for brick, based on Ulysses. And for me, London in The Lesser Bohemians is almost the opposite of that. It's about me recreating the London of my memory. So it's absolutely, that London is autobiographical. And I felt it had to be, in order to imbue the novel with the right kind of feeling and atmosphere, that it had to be almost tactile, that people could feel it and smell it and see it. And I knew recreating what I remembered was a way to do that.

[11:42Skip to 11 minutes and 42 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: So it's a combination of specific places, but also, a really subjective understanding of urban experience.

[11:50Skip to 11 minutes and 50 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: It's incredibly specific, but it is also, it could be fictional. I made a choice early on that I wouldn't go back and check to see if all of these streets led to the places that I said they did or if the bank, HSBC, was still called Midland Bank in 1994. I just decided if it's in my memory, then that's what is in the book. So it's a voyage around my memory of London in '95 rather than actual London in '94, '95.

[12:23Skip to 12 minutes and 23 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: I want to talk a little bit about where Stephen fits into all this. And his - halfway through, we've got this extended piece of reported speech. And he goes back into his past experiences, past trauma, as it were. How do you see this as fitting into the rest of the narrative?

[12:43Skip to 12 minutes and 43 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Well, it works in a number of ways. Firstly, the idea of it really came from my interest in Dostoyevsky's The Devils. And I was always very interested by the appendix, which is Stavrogin's confession. So the whole novel, for those who haven't read it, it's a big political, hefty narrative about these conspirators. And Stavrogin is their leader. And he's very dark, charismatic. But it's not particularly personal. However, Dostoyevsky, the novelist brain clearly couldn't leave it alone, and went away and wrote this long, long section called "Stavrogin's Confession", in which he confessed - he talks about how he raped an 11-year-old girl, who later took her own life. And when the book was first published, he was persuaded to remove it.

[13:42Skip to 13 minutes and 42 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)So it was published without the confession. And it was only in the '20s when it was found amongst, I think, his wife's papers, that it was restored. And even now, it's still printed just at the end of the book. But I was always very interested in the idea of a novel that has another story in it. And I do love nineteenth century novels, and I love, especially, the great Russian - let's sit down, I'll tell you my whole life story. I always really enjoyed those kind of books, and I wanted to see if I could do that.

[14:13Skip to 14 minutes and 13 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)But this idea of having this whole section that is incredibly personal, which really changes how you view the character, but it also exists almost in isolation - so if you took it out, and you didn't ever read it and you didn't get it - would the novel be very different?

[14:32Skip to 14 minutes and 32 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: That's interesting, yeah.

[14:34Skip to 14 minutes and 34 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: So I was sort of intrigued by that. But of course, your understanding of him and everything that happens later is much enriched by knowing all of this stuff. So there was that element to it. But then also, part of the reason why I wanted the age gap to be so big between the two characters was about this shared secret that they have, and the effect of life for her as she's about to start adult life, and she brings this past history with her - how that affects her going forward. And to have him, someone who's much older, whose life has been hugely coloured by that experience in his childhood.

[15:18Skip to 15 minutes and 18 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)And I really wanted to write about what that was like for him to live with that, to go through his life carrying it. So I really wanted to write about his whole life, about the very dramatic initial effects it has on him as a young man, and his drug problems, but then later on as well, about when he becomes a father, and his fear of what's inside him when he's around his own child. So it was - it's really about trying to write about that whole continuum, I suppose, of experience. Because in a way, I think both Eily and Stephen, they function as mirror images of each other. With Stephen's monologue, you're not being told it from inside of him.

[16:03Skip to 16 minutes and 3 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)He is not telling. What you get is her listening.

[16:08Skip to 16 minutes and 8 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Yes. And then telling us.

[16:10Skip to 16 minutes and 10 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Yeah. Well, we hear it because she hears it. But it's about her hearing the story as much as it is about him telling the story. And I don't invade his, the privacy of his consciousness. All you get is what he says and what he would be willing to say.

[16:27Skip to 16 minutes and 27 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Interesting. Because there are a few moments where she intervenes at a few junctures to reassure him or to say, look, I'm still here, and all the rest of it. But yeah, there is that kind of hesitation. I'll sit down and I'll tell you everything, but how much do I want to reveal?

[16:43Skip to 16 minutes and 43 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: And that's - it was very interesting linguistically, to think very carefully about. Of course, you could go into lots of very graphic descriptions of things, but realistically, how much does someone really tell when they tell even the worst things that have happened to them or that they've done? How much detail do they really give? And I often get annoyed by books that - someone is telling someone something, and there's lots of this amazingly gratuitous detail, either sexual or violent. And I just think, no one would ever say that. No one would ever describe this experience in this way to another human being, especially sexual experiences.

[17:21Skip to 17 minutes and 21 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)You could say to someone, well, I slept with so-and-so, but you wouldn't give them a blow-by-blow account of what you did with them in bed.

[17:29Skip to 17 minutes and 29 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Is there a sense in which she - because he's kind of come through the other side slowly and through a great deal of heartache and physical pain, and all the rest of it, this is offering some hope for her as well?

[17:44Skip to 17 minutes and 44 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: I don't know if it's about offering hope. I think when he looks at her, he is often afraid, because he can see her tendency to make the similar kind of choices that he made that had such disastrous consequences throughout his life. I think it's less about hope for her than hope for him. Because I think by the point that he meets her, he's sort of put himself into a kind of emotional stasis, where he can cope with his life by not having any kind of emotional involvement with life.

[18:19Skip to 18 minutes and 19 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)And there are a number of things that have happened just in the run-up to him meeting her. His very close friend for many years has died in the year or two before, and that he's decided to take this sabbatical from acting to write, and what he's writing about is this very psychotic episode he had as a young man. And so in a way, he's almost prepared the ground accidentally for someone to walk in and change his life, which is what happens. And he resists it at first and tries to pretend that it's not that, and tries to protect himself. But it sort of happens anyway.

[19:02Skip to 19 minutes and 2 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Yeah, because you do get the sense, by the ending, or even towards the end, that they're both as invested in this, and both as surprised by - not how quickly it's come - but how intensely these feelings have come between them. But it's really a kind of shared enterprise by the end - we're both in this, what the hell do we do? - kind of thing.

[19:20Skip to 19 minutes and 20 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Well, exactly. And this is also about the idea of her - this year that she grows up. Because she starts off - it starts off in a very stereotypical way. And she's very young, and she's naive, and sexually, she doesn't really know what she wants, but she's eager to please. And by the end, she's someone who has come into her own, who knows what she wants, and who is also - who is now a woman, who is a grown woman, and expects to be treated as that. And he does.

[19:50Skip to 19 minutes and 50 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)And there's this moment where she asks him to do something sexually that he's refused to do earlier in the book, because he says, oh, I don't want to do that with a teenager. And there's a point where she goes, OK, I want you to do it. And he refuses again. And she says, is that how you think of me? As a teenager? And so he does it. And it's about - that's about her, her power and her taking that position for herself, that this is - I'm a grown woman.

[20:19Skip to 20 minutes and 19 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Yeah. Because he is very kind to her, really, for most of it.

[20:23Skip to 20 minutes and 23 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Yeah, he is. He has his moments. But I also wanted to write a book about two people who were kind to each other, who like each other. And even before they really fall in love with each other, they have a nice time together. And he doesn't want to be an asshole to her, and she cares about him. And they like each other, and they enjoy each other's company. And they make mistakes. But it's a very human relationship, I think.

[20:52Skip to 20 minutes and 52 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: How important do you think the, acting, theatre side of it is? Because the title refers to the understated life of the un-starry actor, or maybe out-of-work actor for much of it. But Stephen is an actor, but he doesn't - he's been reasonably successful. You don't get the sense in which he's ever been trudging around for roles or anything. And she also really, really enjoys her life at drama college. So how important do you think the theatrical background is to the characters?

[21:19Skip to 21 minutes and 19 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: I think it was very important. And also the fact that she's a student and he's already quite a successful actor, was part of that mirroring again. But it was - I think using actors, it was interesting because I think the outer and the inner are often quite different. And people can project this very easy-going, approachable exterior, but the inner life can be something that's much more in turmoil. So an actor seemed to be a perfect vehicle for that. And that's very much who he is. And she's still, she's still very - her inner and outer are still very connected at this point in her life, but his are very separate but become more connected as he goes along.

[22:11Skip to 22 minutes and 11 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)So I think there was that, and also just the idea of the performance of the self.

[22:20Skip to 22 minutes and 20 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)Because it's not something that she's learned, but it's something that he has down to a T, to such an extent that he's sort of trapped behind this image of himself as tall, dark, handsome, sexually promiscuous. And again, his - that section I call "The Long Night," which is when he tells his story, is about her viewing under the lid of that, especially that male performance of the self, that she starts to see underneath it.

[22:53Skip to 22 minutes and 53 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Is that how you think he thinks of himself, then, as dashing and distant in that way?

[23:00Skip to 23 minutes and 0 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: No, I don't think he does. I think he sees himself as a broken person. I think he sees himself as someone who has no right to, to all the things that we consider ordinary in life - love and companionship and parenthood. And he feels that those - he doesn't deserve those things, because of what's happened to him, because of what he's done himself in his life. But I think he cultivates a very much, a very easy-going exterior, which hides this tremendous self-loathing, actually, that he carries around inside him.

[23:41Skip to 23 minutes and 41 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Yeah, because he is very - much of it, he's very nonchalant, isn't he? And you'd have no idea at all. And then when he starts to behave quite badly, you think how dare you. And then it's only when it's revealed why this might be, that the sympathy then returns to him, I think.

[23:55Skip to 23 minutes and 55 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Well, I suppose I wasn't really - I'm not writing for sympathy or not. For me, it's about complexity and building up those layers. And it's interesting, again, to put that - without looking at someone from the outside up against the internal monologue that you get with her all the time. So you're getting her blow-by-blow experience of what it's like to be banging up against this very rigid exterior.

[24:20Skip to 24 minutes and 20 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Yeah - how important was it that the novel end on this optimistic note in the, almost strolling down, not literally, but strolling down the road, or lying down on Hampstead Heath, and the sun is on their backs. How important was it that it ended like that?

[24:36Skip to 24 minutes and 36 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: It was very important to me, actually. And I knew how it would end for quite a long time. Before I knew how to get there, I knew what it would be. Because I think in a way, it felt almost like the most transgressive thing I could do. Because this is definitely a relationship that anyone seeing it on paper would just go - oh God, girl, run! Don't go near that one! - And I just, I wanted to have a go with that cliche and try and pull away as much of it as possible and just look at people. And of course, people do things that are messy all the time, when they choose happiness.

[25:22Skip to 25 minutes and 22 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)That's all - because the thing is, they're standing on top of Primrose Hill looking down at London, it's a lovely day. But you know that the next day, he's probably going to have to tell his daughter who's a year younger, that he's with this girl. And what's she going to do next? And how's it going to affect her studies, and all of these things. It's going to be complicated. But also, The Lesser Bohemians is the first book in a trilogy.

[25:51Skip to 25 minutes and 51 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Oh, right. I didn't know that.

[25:53Skip to 25 minutes and 53 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Well, yeah, I didn't really tell anyone at first. But I decided to tell people.

[26:00Skip to 26 minutes and 0 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: So with the same characters?

[26:02Skip to 26 minutes and 2 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: With the same characters, yeah.

[26:04Skip to 26 minutes and 4 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Interesting. So you're working on the other, on number two now, then?

[26:09Skip to 26 minutes and 9 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Yeah.

[26:09Skip to 26 minutes and 9 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: OK, interesting. So we will - you must have in your mind an idea of how this does, then, continue on.

[26:15Skip to 26 minutes and 15 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Yeah. Again, I have an idea of where it will end. I don't know how it will get there.

[26:21Skip to 26 minutes and 21 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: Interesting. I didn't know that.

[26:22Skip to 26 minutes and 22 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)EIMEAR: Well, there you go.

[26:24Skip to 26 minutes and 24 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185675#)ALEX: I look forward to it.
