# Varieties of speech[** View324 comments](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185510#fl-comments)

In the previous step we considered the impact of dialect voices in a novel. In following example taken from [Walter Scott’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Scott) 1818 novel [*The Heart of Midlothian*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heart_of_Midlothian), there is a stark contrast between the polite literary English of the narrator’s discourse, and the colloquial dialect speech of the Scottish characters:

> “He’s a gude creature,” said she, “and a kind – it’s a pity he has sae willyard a powny.” And she immediately turned her thoughts to the important journey which she had commenced, reflecting with pleasure, that, according to her habits of life and of undergoing fatigue, she was now amply or even superfluously provided with the means of encountering the expenses of the road, up and down from London, and all other expenses whatever.

As we see there, lines of dialect can inject variety to a novel, while affording textual space to characters from a different sound world to that of the narrator.

But it is not overstating the case to suggest that the depiction of characters speaking in dialect can in some cases be considered a revolutionary gesture: clearing a space for individuals to articulate themselves in their own linguistic register, without a narrator who might attempt to either interpret or neutralise their words, can carry tremendous political force.

This is particularly the case in Lewis Grassic Gibbon’s trilogy [*A Scots Quair*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Scots_Quair). The three novels, published in the early 1930s and set in north-east Scotland, focus mainly on Chris Guthrie, who grows up in a pre-war rural farming community, moves to the town of Segget with her first husband, and finally ends up in Duncairn, a fictional city. We’ll be having a look at an excerpt from the final novel in the trilogy, *Grey Granite*, in the next step, before considering what impact the Scots voices have on us, the reader.
