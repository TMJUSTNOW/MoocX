# Presenting a variety of perspectives

In this video Dr Alex Lawrie considers the effect of having several characters continue a conversation without any intervention from the narrator. What is the impact of being denied an authoritative commentary on events?

[0:10Skip to 0 minutes and 10 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185673#)As well as revealing certain things about each character, what dialogue also does is inject a novel with variety. There's the potential that we'll hear a range of different voices coming from different perspectives and points of view, but each afforded space and time in the novel. This can introduce moments of energy and richness into a scene, really quickening the pace while at the same time providing an alternative to that authoritative voiceover effect we're familiar with from third-person narration. Consider the following passage from George Eliot's 1861 novel, Silas Marner. The novel is set back in time, in the early nineteenth century, and takes place in a rural English village called Raveloe.

They're having a rather aimless debate about a cow. But the scene brings together men from the town of Raveloe in discussion, and the narrator doesn't at any point step in to offer an impartial and presumably reliable understanding of events, for the benefit of the reader. "The farrier looked fierce, and the mild butcher's conversational spirit was roused a little. 'I'm not for contradicking no man,' he said; 'I'm for cutting 'em short myself; but I don't quarrel with 'em.

'Well, it's the cow as I drenched, whatever it is,' pursued the farrier, angrily; 'and it was Mr. Lammeter's cow, else you told a lie when you said it was a red Durham.'

[1:38Skip to 1 minute and 38 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185673#)'I tell no lies,' said the butcher, with the same mild huskiness as before, 'and I contradick none - not if a man was to swear himself black: he's no meat o' mine, nor none o' my bargains. All I say is, it's a lovely carkiss. And what I say I'll stick to; but I'll quarrel wi' no man.' 'No,' said the farrier, with bitter sarcasm, looking at the company generally; 'and p'rhaps you aren't pig-headed; and p'rhaps you didn't say she'd got a star on her brow - stick to that, now you're at it.' 'Come, come,' said the landlord; 'let the cow alone.

It's important to note here, the lack of a third-person narrative voice, who might clear up this confusion once and for all, giving us the final word about whose cow was slaughtered. Each of the men in the tavern are allowed their say, and their opinions are considered valid. By refusing to offer any definitive clarification, the narrator, like the landlord, doesn't seem comfortable that there simply is one true version.

[2:52Skip to 2 minutes and 52 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185673#)And this has a levelling effect - no one, not even the narrator, seems to know the full story, and it doesn't really matter. The fact that the men are speaking in dialect is also worth thinking about, and this is something the next section will explore more fully.
