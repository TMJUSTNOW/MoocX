## Flashbacks and decelerated pace

As outlined in that overview, this novel plays around with time to a quite considerable degree, and one could say that this is entirely appropriate given the thematic emphasis it gives to ancestry, future legacies, and the crushing weight of history. At the level of structure, the novel might shift, from one section to the next, from Allmon’s adolescence six or seven years before the present-day of the narrative, to an account of Scipio’s journey out of the South (and his own story of escape just before this), and forwards again to 2003, and life on Forge Run Farm.

But there is also considerable playing around with time within many of these sections, as characters recall past events, the narrative jumps weeks and even months ahead, and the plot seems to stop altogether to highlight the intensity of a particular moment.

One short example of a flashback occurs when Henry, grieving, and with his baby grandson in his arms, is guided out of his house by kindly neighbour Ginnie Miller to have a meal with her and her husband across the road:

> Henry wanted to retreat – his whole body was an open wound without hope of a scab – but he lacked the strength or volition to withdraw; he allowed Ginnie to guide him through his own front hall, down the sloping lawn of his childhood, across the black ribbon road to the Miller property. He hadn’t set foot on their land since he was ten. God, had he once been a little boy with a father and a mother still alive? The years had flung themselves past him with stunning certitude and no mercy at all.

Walking over to his neighbour’s property at this moment of real frailty for Henry has the unanticipated effect of spooling back the several decades when he was last there. But the rushing of time seems to increase his heartache, forcibly reminding him how painful some of those in-between years have been – and none more so than the present moment.

As well as flashbacks, the novel also makes very good use of deceleration, where time seems to slow down quite dramatically. Very near the end of the novel Henry is stunned by the reappearance of a woman he doesn’t at first recognise. This is the moment when he works out who she is:

> Time distended to the point of bursting, and nothing made a sound. The tea leaves settled in the pot. Nothing moved except Henry’s blood, which was older than time and could only be called by one name, a surname, which was a useless thing really, signifying nothing, a word that began with force in your ancestor’s lungs and died with a curl of the tongue behind your teeth.

As the revelation slowly dawns on Henry, the pace decelerates to the point of a total halt. The effect of this information is to take him out of time altogether, stopping all movement except the slow whirring of his subconscious mind. By elongating this particular moment, the author demonstrates its dramatic impact on Henry. But elsewhere weeks, or even much longer periods, are skipped over entirely in the narrative, a sign that nothing significant to the plot took place in that time.
