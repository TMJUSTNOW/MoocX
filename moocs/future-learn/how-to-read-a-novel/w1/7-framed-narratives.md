# Framed narratives

In the videos we looked at aspects relating to temporality - things like flashbacks and narrative duration. Another thing to remember when thinking about the world of a novel is that not every detail is likely to be communicated to the reader. Although I suggested earlier that some authors go into tremendous detail about seemingly trivial incidents, most novelists are much more sparing with the amount of material they offer us, while others seem to deliberately withhold information from the reader. Now we’re going to look at gaps or ellipses in the plot – those aspects we feel are being kept from us, the result either of some sort of structural difficulty with accessing the story, or of a narrator whom we feel we cannot trust.

To take the first of these issues first: in some instances the crux, or the truth, governing the plot might be there, but in order to reach it we as readers are required to first read a series of preliminary notes, or “frames”. These might take the form of a preface, introductory letter, or opening note about how the narrator came to be in possession of the story we are about to read. Consider the following example from [Jonathan Swift’s 1726 novel *Gulliver’s Travels*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels), where the so-called “publisher” introduces Gulliver’s account of his travels, and offers a veneer of authenticity to the rest of the text:

> THE AUTHOR of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my antient and intimate Friend; there is likewise some Relation between us by the Mother’s Side…

> Before he quitted Redriff, he left the Custody of the following Papers in my Hands, with the Liberty to dispose of them as I should think fit. I have carefully perused them three Times: The style is very plain and simple; and the only Fault I find is, that the Author, after the Manner of Travelers, is a little too circumstantial. There is an Air of Truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the Author was so distinguished for his Veracity, that it became a Sort of Proverb among his Neighbours at Redriff, when any one affirmed a Thing, to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.

This type of “framing narrative” is only really significant, though, when it seeks to alter or influence the way in which we understand the main body of the text. All Swift’s frame has done is suggest that we should take the rest of the story seriously – that it is accurate and genuine: it has an “Air of Truth” about it, and Gulliver is already known amongst acquaintances for his “Veracity”.

Other frames, on the other hand, have many more layers, and are much more complicated. A famous example of this is [Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel *Frankenstein*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein). This novel is entirely made up of letters written by someone called Robert Walton to his sister. Within these letters, the story of a secondary narrator, that of Victor Frankenstein, is embedded. And within that account from Victor, we hear a series of other stories, not least that told by Victor Frankenstein’s monster.

A frame story, then, of which this is a key example, contains another story, or even several other stories, within that outside structure. It is useful to think of this as a series of concentric circles enveloping the main plot, making it progressively more difficult for the reader to reach the truth at its core. Because more than simply providing us with another layer of narrative, what each of these frames also do (certainly in the case of Mary Shelley’s novel), is bring their own personality and prejudices to bear on the story it encloses. For instance: in one of the opening letters to his sister, Robert Walton hints at the fact that, firstly, he is captivated by Victor, and secondly, that his account will not be strictly accurate:

> I have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips, with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within. Strange and harrowing must be his story; frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course, and wrecked it – thus!

Given these preconceptions Walton admits to having about Victor and his story, we can assume that when he appears to hand over the narrative to Victor at the start of Chapter One, his presence and personality will continue to overlay that main story.

Can you think of any examples of “framing” from your own reading?
