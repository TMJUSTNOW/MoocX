# Further frames and unreliable narrators

Joseph Conrad’s 1899 text [*Heart of Darkness*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness) is structured in a similar way to Mary Shelley’s *Frankenstein*: the central plot is communicated to the reader by Marlow, but he is introduced to us by another narrator, who remains anonymous, but who has the first and last words. And within Marlow’s narration, which we follow for much of the novel, there is another story – that of Kurtz – which never really gets told, and which feels ultimately unknowable, enigmatic. And again, within Kurtz’s own narrative, there are several other plots which he has constructed – a lie he asks Marlow to pass on to his fiancée after his death, and the manuscript of a report he has written.

Marlow’s own narrative style – the way he tells his version of the plot – is also worth considering here. This brings us onto that second issue of the unreliable narrator. That anonymous voice introducing us to Marlow appears to be bored by Marlow, and is dismissive about what he has to say: he describes him as sitting in “the pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a lotus-flower” – that is, without the enlightenment linked to that role.

A little later, when Marlow begins to tell his story, the narrator remarks rather wearily that “we knew we were fated, before the ebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlow’s inconclusive experiences”. Given the rather fed-up tone of the narrator’s introduction, there may be reasons to question the accuracy of what he reports of Marlow’s story.

But Marlow himself, although placing himself in the position of storyteller, also appears to be wilfully obstructing us from getting at the crux, or the truth, of what he is telling us: he claims, for instance, not to belong to a world of straightforward facts, as though language has lost its power to communicate a stable, irrefutable meaning. Consider the following passage, when Marlow breaks off from a difficult, possibly incriminating, part of his story:

> ”. . . No, it is impossible; it is impossible to convey the life-sensation of any given epoch of one’s existence – that which makes its truth, its meaning – its subtle and penetrating essence. It is impossible. We live, as we dream – alone . . .”

Some experiences, Marlow suggests here, are literally “unspeakable”, and elude the authority of language. Note also those ellipses, a sign of uneasy hesitation, as his words drift off.

Another reason not to trust Marlow is down to the fact that he is personally involved in the plot he narrates. This tends to be a key basis for unreliability. He seems intent on justifying his involvement in colonial systems and explaining his reverence for the mysterious Kurtz. But this proves difficult to do, and Marlow’s plot is therefore full of holes: his narrative style is characterised by gaps and dashes, as he tries to avoid telling us the truth:

> Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look for hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in all the glories of exploration. At that time there were many blank spaces on the earth, and when I saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map (but they all look that), I would put my finger on it and say, When I grow up I will go there. The North Pole was one of these places, I remember. Well, I haven’t been there yet, and shall not try now. The glamour’s off. Other places were scattered about the Equator, and in every sort of latitude over the two hemispheres. I have been in some of them, and . . . well, we won’t talk about that. But there was one yet – the biggest, the most blank, so to speak – that I had a hankering after.

Notice how again that ellipsis appears when Marlow wishes to avoid talking about something – in this case, colonialism. These holes in the narrative indicate to the alert reader that he cannot be trusted; he is skirting around the truth, rather than telling us things directly.

There are even moments when he admits to lies that he had told to protect the appalling Kurtz and his reputation, thereby cementing this impression of untrustworthiness, and further suggesting that his value system must be flawed if he is intent on protecting such an individual.

It is often the case that the narrator is unreliable when the plot is being communicated to us by a character who feels obliged to explain or excuse their own past behaviour.
