# Welcome!

Welcome to this course on How to Read a Novel! During the next four weeks, we’ll be looking at the main building blocks of fiction: plot, characterisation, dialogue, and setting.

We’ll be showing you how the various techniques relating to each of these components function in a range of different novels, and we’ll also be drawing on the four books selected for this year’s [James Tait Black](http://www.ed.ac.uk/events/james-tait-black)fiction [shortlist](http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2017/exciting-blend-of-books-make-prize-list), based here at the University of Edinburgh.

Those four novels are:

- C. E. Morgan, **The Sport of Kings**
- Garth Greenwell, **What Belongs to You**
- Eimear McBride, **The Lesser Bohemians**
- Jo Baker, **A Country Road, A Tree**.

There will be plenty of excerpts from each of these novels to read and discuss, but feel free to get hold of copies of them if you wish to do so.

This week we’ll be looking at how various plots are structured, with particular focus on narrative pace, flashbacks and flash-forwards, and narrative perspective.
