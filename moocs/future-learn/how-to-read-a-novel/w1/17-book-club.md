## Book club

If you haven’t read the whole book, what did you think about the extracts we looked at earlier on? If you wish, you can broaden the discussion to plotting devices in novels more generally.

And if you’ve read more of the book, why not give your own examples of some of the strategies we’ve looked at in these steps? For instance:

- Where does the narrative perspective seem to shift, and what’s the effect of that?
- Do any of the narrators appear to be unreliable?
- Who do you think is the central consciousness?
- And what seems to be missing from the plot – are there any gaps in the narrative?
