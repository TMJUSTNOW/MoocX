## From plot to characterisation

This week, we’ve been looking at key strategies used by authors to alter the temporal progression of the narrative – these include devices such as flashback, flash-forward, summary, and deceleration.

- We have also reflected on the effects generated by a narrative frame, particularly the ways this alters how we understand the main body of the text.
- You have learnt how to evaluate novels for signs of narrative unreliability.
- Finally, you have seen how these various strategies operate within C. E. Morgan’s novel *The Sport of Kings*.

Next week, we’ll be moving onto the issue of characterisation: we’ll consider how appearances, speech, and behavioural patterns function as a way of revealing character. And we’ll also be looking at several examples from Garth Greenwell’s novel *What Belongs to You*.
