## Repetition of events

And as well as slowing things down and speeding them up, at several moments in this novel an event which clearly happens over and over is described to us only once. This is a reasonably common trope, particularly effective for conveying the repetitive, cyclical nature of the farming year, where the seasonal rhythms have a predictability which means they do not require narrative repetition.

Because this novel is set on a horse farm the cycles of breeding, birth and training are important, but these seasons are often conveyed in a timeless, non-specific manner (almost as though a wide-angle lens has been used) which suggests the same sequence happens year on year:

> Spring comes as a reconnoitring scout, a first slip of green peeking from the very bough tips of the oak, barely there at all, just a weighted abeyance. Winter is damaged but still dreadful and full of poison ice and useless powder; every human heart senses that brief lull; it’s only a first flirtation, but they’re raw with expectation, impatient after the long revolution of the year. They let their stoves and hearths go cold. They turn their animals loose as a prayerful incantation.

But this technique doesn’t just apply to nature’s rhythms. The following example concerns Henry’s grown-up daughter Henrietta (who is heavily involved in the breeding and care of the Thoroughbreds) and her thoughts about the Kentucky Derby:

> And, of course, she remembered all of the Derbys, though like most in the business, she was interested in the results and impatient with the festivities, which rankled like overeating store-bought cake on a full stomach, all sickly layers of drunkenness, celebrity, and overexposure of every kind. She wasn’t one to mingle in Millionaires Row, watching men shake hands and clap each other on the back, standing dutifully beside her father in their hermetically sealed box. She spent some of the afternoon checking in on Seconds Flat on the backstretch, then braving the crowds at the betting arcade and the food stands, where bettors jostled cheek to jowl and the offense of hot burgoo, sweat, and treacly perfume was undercut only by the persistent and oddly comforting odor of manure.

Note there that the passage offers us a generalised depiction of Derby Day and its similar celebratory atmosphere year on year (that wide-angle lens noted above), against the blurred and frenetic background of which we zoom into Henrietta, as she goes about her own preparations for this particular year’s race.

A similar thing happens in the next chapter, which narrates the rhythms of Allmon’s childhood. Again, these are things that happened over and over again, but it’s only necessary to tell us once:

> She soothed his heat rash with creams and kissed his sweating head. Sometimes she cried over his pertussive crying and crushed him to her despite the heat. And when he napped, she sang a hush song, sang Hush a bye don’t you cry go to sleepy little baby when you wake you shall have all the pretty horses blacks and bays dapples and grays coach and six white horses, hush.

> Sometimes, there was a man in the house. He was a white man; he came and went. When it rained, the streets smelled faintly of the distant river.

The effect of this is to communicate routine, repetitive childhood moments – although note also the rather ominous tone of the second shorter paragraph: this may also be a recurring event, but it is very different in nature from the others.
