Here, Alex Lawrie shows you how time in a novel can be accelerated or slowed down. She looks at why some moments appear to be unduly elongated, or (at the other end of the spectrum) skipped over entirely.

Authors will make other decisions relating to plotting besides the flashback and flash-forward. Obviously the length of time it takes for you to read a book will almost never correspond to the events taking place within its pages. Otherwise novels would be an interminable length. But sometimes a difference between the two will be exaggerated. Several pages of a book might be devoted to a single moment which has the effect of slowing things down. So the narrator or character can linger on a precise detail or moment. Almost as though they're working in slow motion, or stopping altogether. Sensory detail can become important here. Although it feels as though nothing is missed.

French writer Marcel Proust in the early decades of the 20th century was one of the most famous exponents of this slowed down style. The novel In Search of Lost Time, a title translated from the French, recounts the experiences and memories of the narrator, Marcel, but this takes place over several volumes. Let's have a look now at how Proust went about it.

The drying of the stems had twisted them into a fantastic trellis, in the interlacing of which the pale flowers opened, as though a painter had arranged them there, grouping them in the most decorative poses.

[1:40Skip to 1 minute and 40 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185664#)The leaves, having lost or altered their original appearance, resembled the most disparate things, the transparent wing of a fly, the blank side of a label, the petal of a rose, which had all been piled together, pounded or interwoven like the materials for a nest.

[1:56Skip to 1 minute and 56 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185664#)A thousand trifling little details - a charming prodigality on the part of the chemist - details which would have been eliminated from an artificial preparation, gave me, like a book in which one reads with astonished delight the name of a person one knows, the pleasure of finding that these were sprigs of real lime trees, like those I had seen, when coming from the train, in the Avenue de la Gare, altered indeed, precisely because they were not imitations but themselves, and because they had aged.

[2:24Skip to 2 minutes and 24 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185664#)And as each new character is merely a metamorphosis from something earlier, in these little grey balls I recognised green buds plucked before their time; but beyond all else the rosy, lunar, tender gleam that lit up the blossoms among the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden roses." Note there the attention paid to tiny details. The appearance of dried leaves, for example, and the way in which this allows time to practically stand still. What the author is doing is tailoring narrative space to match the intensity of an individual's perception of any given moment.

[2:59Skip to 2 minutes and 59 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185664#)And on the other hand, a long period of time, years even, might be skipped over in a novel and afforded almost no textual space at all. Of course all novels employ summary to some extent, and snatches of dialogue are used to represent conversations rather than presenting us with the entire scene. This has the opposite effect of speeding up the action. Time is compressed very effectively in the middle section of Virginia Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse, for instance, where an entire decade takes up less than 20 pages. This contrasts strikingly with the much longer, more measured sections on either side. Each of which are devoted to just one day of a family holiday on the Island of Skye.

[3:37Skip to 3 minutes and 37 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185664#)While the family isn't there in this middle section, the house is left to decay and ruin. But we glance over this relatively quickly, and largely in the absence of a human consciousness that might have served to expand or elongate individual moments. The aim of this section has been to focus on some of the choices commonly taken by authors when deciding how to structure the plot of their novels in order to achieve a particular dramatic effect. In what order they might reveal certain details about their characters' pasts or futures to the reader for instance. And how they go about slowing down or speeding up the pace of their novels.
