# Set the scene

This week we turn our attention to the issue of setting.

- We’re going to consider what impact a novel’s geographical setting can have on its plot or mood - whether town or country, local or abroad, detailed or vague.
- We’ll also look at the relationship between environment and character - that is, how an individual’s disposition might be linked to their surroundings.
- And we’ll be looking at plenty of examples from Jo Baker’s novel *A Country Road, A Tree*, where setting plays a crucial role.

But first, why not upload a photograph of where you live, and suggest what kind of novel might be set there? Or choose another location which seems to suit a particular type of plot. Perhaps your photo is of somewhere you live or pass by regularly, or a place you’re visiting. If you prefer to draw something, you can share that instead.

Go to the Flickr album [How to Read a Novel (#FL Novel)](https://www.flickr.com/groups/flnovel/) and upload your photo there. Or use the hashtag #FLNovel if you want to post your photo elsewhere.
