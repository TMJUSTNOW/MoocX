# Overview of A Country Road, A Tree[** View487 comments](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185575#fl-comments)

In the previous steps we considered some of the effects generated by careful use of setting. We’re now going to apply our understanding of this to Jo Baker’s 2016 novel *A Country Road, A Tree*.

The novel is a re-creation of Samuel Beckett’s experiences during the Second World War, which he spent in France, variously in occupied Paris, Roussillon, and finally Normandy, where he co-ordinated the construction of a Red Cross hospital. The novel begins, though, in Ireland: one of the opening scenes shows Beckett at home with his mother and cousins in September 1939, feeling claustrophobic and desperate to return to Paris and to his girlfriend, Suzanne.

The novel follows a linear structure: much of the early part is set in Paris, where Beckett and Suzanne try to carry on despite dire food rationing, brutally cold temperatures, and the threat of capture by the Gestapo – many of their friends are arrested, and Beckett’s work for the French Resistance means he is constantly at risk of exposure. Later sections trace the couple’s perilous journey to the Free Zone, having fled Paris, and their precarious existence in the rural village of Roussillon.

As that short description suggests, setting is central to Baker’s novel, and the ways in which various places are depicted tells us a great deal about the condition of Europe at that time, as well as the mindset of the characters.
