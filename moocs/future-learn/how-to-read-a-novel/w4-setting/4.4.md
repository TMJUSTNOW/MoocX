In this video Dr Alex Lawrie considers how relatively anonymous urban settings can still evoke a particular atmosphere. And she looks at how authors such as Jane Austen and George Eliot paint a convincing picture of rural life by offering thousands of small details about fictional villages.

But other novels, which feel indelibly linked to their city and rely heavily on recognisable landmarks, also manage to evoke a particular atmosphere that isn't necessarily connected to these broader urban structures. Joseph Conrad's London spy novel, The Secret Agent, for instance, which was published in 1907, but set twenty years earlier, in 1886, features as his main plot strand an attempt to blow up the Greenwich Observatory. Yet with Conrad, as feels appropriate in a novel about plotting and political espionage, the London we're placed in here feels murky and clandestine, full of dark corners and brooding streets.

[0:53Skip to 0 minutes and 53 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185678#)Take the following description of the city, which is given just after an awkward meeting at an underground bar between two anarchists, and just before one of them stumbles into a police inspector. "In front of the great doorway, a dismal row of newspaper sellers standing clear of the pavement dealt out their wares from the gutter. It was a raw, gloomy day of the early spring; and the grimy sky, the mud of the streets, the rags of the dirty men, harmonised excellently with the eruption of the damp, rubbishy sheets of paper soiled with printer's ink." This isn't the touristy image of London, this is the dank and dangerous version running parallel to it. It feels ominous, menacing.

[1:34Skip to 1 minute and 34 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185678#)Much of the plot takes place in private rooms, which lend themselves to the characters' feelings of nervousness and isolation, and the suspicion which follows their every movement. Consider the following passage from page one of the novel. This is a description of the shop owned by Mr. Verloc, the "secret agent" of the title. His shop sells pornographic material, but it is also largely a front, or smokescreen, because in one of the back rooms, where Verloc's family live, he holds meetings with his anarchist acquaintances. "The shop was small, and so was the house. It was one of those grimy brick houses which existed in large quantities before the era of reconstruction dawned upon London.

[2:10Skip to 2 minutes and 10 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185678#)The shop was a square box of a place, with the front glazed in small panes. In the daytime the door remained closed; in the evening, it stood discreetly but suspiciously ajar." Anonymity here seems to be the point. It is essential for Verloc's purposes that the shop doesn't stand out. In the next chapter we see him walking around the city's public spaces, Hyde Park corner, Knightsbridge, and although he lives nearby, we're aware that his own private pocket of London, and thousands more like it, exists alongside that more polished version.

Why is it important that this particular city was chosen? What resonances does it throw up? And which specific areas are being used?

[3:07Skip to 3 minutes and 7 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185678#)But when we talk about setting, this doesn't necessarily have to be a town or place we recognise. Jane Austen, for instance, was a master at bringing it together, from thousands of small details, a complete picture of life in a provincial English village, which feels authentically three-dimensional. We're given the geography of the place, and told where the characters live in relation to each other. Also, where the school is and the larger estates. Mapped onto this of course, we also know people's occupations, their attitudes and their way of life. But crucially, these places are fictional. Mansfield Park is not a real country house, Highbury is not an actual village.

[3:46Skip to 3 minutes and 46 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185678#)The same can be said for George Eliot's novel Middlemarch, published in 1872, but set in a fictitious Midlands town between 1829 and 1832. The extraordinary level of detail, or thick description, Eliot provides in this novel means that at times it feels more like a sociological document than a work of fiction. The major social and political changes taking place at this moment in time, the early 1830s, serve as a backdrop for the more significant personal dramas experienced by the characters. So, why write it in this way, with such emphasis on local detail? Well, perhaps one reason might be that, for Eliot, ordinary, provincial people's lives are important and worthy of portrayal and in-depth examination.

[4:24Skip to 4 minutes and 24 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185678#)So there's a democratising endeavour at work here. These people and this town, she seems to be saying, are worth bothering with. And the effort Eliot puts into getting all the details of a fictional town just right is therefore central to her moral project.
