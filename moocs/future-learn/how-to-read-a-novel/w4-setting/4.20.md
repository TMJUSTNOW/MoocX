In this, our final week, we considered what impact a novel’s geographical setting can have on its plot or mood.

- We also looked at the relationship between environment and character, or how an individual’s disposition might be linked to their surroundings.
- And we looked at plenty of useful examples from Jo Baker’s novel.

Congratulations for reaching the end of the course, and thanks for completing it!
