# Environment as a plot device[** View354 comments](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185572#fl-comments)

Many famous authors, of course, have chosen rural settings for their novels, and just like the Brontë sisters and West Yorkshire, they have become firmly linked with that part of the country – [Thomas Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy), for instance, set so many of his books in a part of south-west England known as [Wessex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy%27s_Wessex) that he is now synonymous with that area. But we might also consider the specific changes a physical environment can enact on a character: the American novelist [Henry James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_James) set many of his novels in Europe, with much of the dramatic energy in his plots stemming from the negotiation of Old World culture by American protagonists.

And a similar idea governs several of [E. M. Forster’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._M._Forster) plots: three of the five novels he published during his lifetime were set in other countries, with this foreign location triggering a sexual transformation in the English characters, who feel more liberated when away from home, and therefore able to break from the constraints of their class.

In the case of [*Where Angels Fear to Tread*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Angels_Fear_to_Tread) (1905) and [*A Room with a View*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Room_with_a_View) (1908), the Italian setting opens up emotions in the English protagonists (passionate, sexual, cultural) which they can apply to their circumstances back home, but the actual country and its people tend to be abandoned once they have served their purpose in the plot.
