# Review another learner's assignment

Once you’ve submitted your own assignment, why not read the response of another learner and provide them with some constructive feedback using the guidelines below.

#### ASSIGNMENT GUIDELINES

You’re going to be asked to give feedback on the following aspects of the author’s assignment:

- What is the relationship between the landscape and Beckett's mood?
- Which line or lines from the extract can be used to illustrate your point?
- Have you written clearly and concisely?

You must first submit an assignment in the previous step before you can review other learners’ assignments.
