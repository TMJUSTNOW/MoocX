Drawing on examples from James Joyce’s *Ulysses* and Virginia Woolf’s *Mrs Dalloway*, Alex Lawrie considers how city settings can become integral to the workings of the plot. Carefully mapped journeys can build up a realistic picture of the city, and even ensure that characters bump into each other, allowing the narrative focus to transfer from one person to another.

The literal, physical contours of the city became critical when Joyce sat down to write it. He even had a map of Dublin in front of him so he could be accurate with the time it took for characters to walk certain distances, and ensure their paths crossed at the right places. The novel is therefore saturated in local detail so that it feels possible to piece together the city as it stood when the novel was set in June 1904.

Our view of Father Conmee at the start, of which the following is just an excerpt, is one of the longest.

It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be. A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian brother boys. Father Conmee smelled incense on his right hand as he walked. St. Joseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.

Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. And now it was an office or something. Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr. William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee saluted Mr. William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York... Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lunged. They saluted him and were saluted." Notice there are a number of real locations mentioned.

[2:00Skip to 2 minutes and 0 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185677#)Looking at a map of Dublin, we can actually trace Father Conmee on his journey through the city. When a novelist is this specific with setting, even down to street names and shops, generally he or she wants us to believe the scene is really taking place. Verisimilitude has become a priority, When you're reading a novel, take the time to notice if the author has bothered to include things like local landmarks.

[2:25Skip to 2 minutes and 25 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185677#)In Virginia Woolf's novel Mrs. Dalloway, as we saw earlier, the title character walks through central London on a June morning in 1923. And we map her journey through the city. But crucially, her voyage also intersects or crisscrosses with those of the other characters, who variously hop on buses, walk through Regent's Park, have flashbacks about the war, fall in and out of love, die even. But it's all contained within a London that is very deliberately and tangibly marked by landmarks and monuments. So these geographical sites function as passing points in the various characters.

[3:05Skip to 3 minutes and 5 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185677#)They might not meet each other, but the fact that they're in the same place at the same time allows narrative to alter or change gear, leaping at that moment of intersection from the head of one character to that of the person they walk past. In the following passage, we see Rezia Smith trying to talk to her husband, Septimus, who's a shell-shocked veteran of World War One, and at this moment, hallucinating. Peter Walsh walks past them in Regent's Park and imagines they're having a simple lover's tiff. "'The time, Septimus,' Rezia repeated. 'What is the time?' He was talking, he was starting, this man must notice him. He was looking at them.

[3:40Skip to 3 minutes and 40 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185677#)'I will tell you the time,' said Septimus, very slowly, very drowsily, smiling mysteriously at the dead man in the grey suit. As he sat smiling, the quarter struck - the quarter to twelve. And that is being young, Peter Walsh thought as he passed them. To be having an awful scene - the poor girl looking absolutely desperate - in the middle of the morning. But what was it about? he wondered; what had the young man in the overcoat been saying to make her look like that; what awful fix had they got themselves into, both to look so desperate as that on a fine summer morning?

[4:23Skip to 4 minutes and 23 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185677#)The amusing thing about coming back to England, after five years, was the way it made, anyhow the first days, things stand out as if one had never seen them before; lovers squabbling under a tree; the domestic family life of the parks." Notice in that passage how focus shifts from the couple to Peter at the very moment he walks past them. After speculating for a moment about the cause of their argument, his thoughts drift off to his own impressions of London after five years away.
