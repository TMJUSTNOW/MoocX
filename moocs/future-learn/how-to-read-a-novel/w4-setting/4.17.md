Watch an interview with Jo Baker where she reflects on her experience of writing the novel. She talks about setting, the creation of Beckett the character, and the novel’s prose style.

If you are short of time, we’ve recommended a few highlights:

Talking about Roussillon, where much of *A Country Road, A Tree* is set, Baker stresses how important it was to her to visit the village while writing the novel:

> (1:46) Finding that sense of that place was really important. And… I could have guessed at it, but I’m really glad I didn’t, because I don’t think it would have come so sort of physically alive. And getting a sense of the - it’s a very strange landscape, because most of it around there is limestone. And then you’ve got this little outcrop where the town is, Roussillon, that’s red. It’s ochre, and they buy ochre there. And so **that sense of blood and rust and the physicality of that**… came real for me in a way that, if I just read around it and heard that it was red, wouldn’t have felt quite so visceral I think.

One of the key aspects of Beckett’s wartime experiences in France that Baker tries to reflect is the extreme privation that he, along with many others, experienced:

> (4:58) I’m fascinated, I think, by how you respond to dearth. That became really important, that sort of sense of how the body is worn down by these experiences and how relationships are worn down by these experiences. And just the sort of the detail of the physicality of things, like when she eats those pears, **I’m very invested in the pear-iness of the pear. And the experience of that to someone who’s been getting by on things that are so basic, and so, sort of - can you say drab with food? So utilitarian, so sort of just calories, we need calories, we need carbs, we need, you know, that’s fat, we’ll have that.** Trying to get by on that kind of basic level. And the idea of the luxury of a pear, because pears are really luxurious if you get a good one. And so yes, that, for me, was a real moment of a sort of cusp being turned as well. That’s as things begin to get better, really, I think. And if there can be pears, if there can be a bag full of pears, then maybe we’re moving into a better phase again.

In many ways, Baker’s novel contradicts the popular image of Beckett as very serious and humourless (or - as Alex puts it - “miserable!”). Here, Baker talks about how finding more out about Beckett’s life changed her view of him:

> (9:52) He didn’t have to go back at all. He could have just stayed in Ireland. He didn’t have to face any of it. And it was that series of extraordinary decisions, becoming aware of how they racked up, one after the other, from going back to, as you say, giving his rations up when he’s already just on subsistence rations himself, to then deciding to join the resistance when he’s not, frankly, a practical man. The work he gets suits him. And that continues, extraordinary decision after extraordinary decision. **I think he’s an extraordinary man. I mean, I already admired the work, but as I found out more about the biography I increasingly admired the man.**

Later, Baker talks about the narrative style of her novel, and of Beckett’s unlikely enthusiasm for Jane Austen (he called her “the divine Jane”):

> (21:03) I’d just come from *Longbourn*… a book that was telling a story that was parallel to Austen’s. So in that one, I move - I do the free indirect style, and I quite happily just land on someone else’s shoulder and drift into their thoughts and drift out again and then fly away and land on someone else’s shoulder. That’s the kind of freedom that Austen’s style can give you. Beckett was a big Austen fan as well. So it was quite nice to take just a shred of that technique, and **I’m mostly on his shoulder, and I’m mostly dipping into his thoughts**. And there’s plenty of people that we don’t enter the thoughts of. Like I don’t go into - Joyce is just from the outside. But I do dip into Suzanne, from her point of view, and I do dip into his mother’s point of view. And as far as I recall, those are just the three. And it’s a little bit cheeky, because that was just what I allowed myself, because I did want - it is his story, but those two other figures in there are so key to it, and they do, I think, need to be able to give a moment of him from outside, that we see how he’s seen and how he’s loved.

It has been said that a writer should “never let the truth get in the way of a good story.” How important do you think accuracy is in novels based on real people and events? Which is more important, the truth or the story?

[0:07Skip to 0 minutes and 7 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: OK, I'm just going to start off by asking you about setting. It seems really striking in the novel, the way setting is used. You've got Paris under German occupation, then you've got the countryside around Roussillon. And then you've also got County Wicklow, where Beckett seems really kind of miserable, near the start, and also towards the end. So, how conscious were you trying to get the details of all these different settings right?

[0:28Skip to 0 minutes and 28 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: Yeah, I mean it was one of those things where you realise you're going to have to do some sort of very specific, different kinds of research of different places in order to get the feel of it. I mean, you have to make an emotional connection to place in order to get the feel of it, to get under the skin of a place. And I lived in Ireland for about ten years. I lived in the north, but often you'd be down and back and forth, so I had a kind of lived experience of Ireland a bit.

[1:06Skip to 1 minute and 6 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)And Paris, obviously not under occupation, I've spent quite a lot of time in Paris down the years, and just been going there a lot. We've got friends there, we've spent time there. So that had an emotional connection for me. So those two areas, those two locales felt already sort of physical for me. So I'd like put myself in that place, or put a character in that place, and have them move through it in a way that felt real for me, that I could sort of like close my eyes and imagine myself, transport myself there. But Roussillon I'd never been, so we actually decided that - well, I decided, we decided we'd all go down there and spend some time.

[1:44Skip to 1 minute and 44 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)And so - ALEX: Lovely.

[1:46Skip to 1 minute and 46 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: It became a kind of research trip. France - yeah, absolutely necessary! And I'm really glad we did, because finding that sense of that place was really important. And if - I could have guessed at it, but I'm really glad I didn't, because I don't think it would have come so sort of physically alive. And getting a sense of the - it's a very strange landscape, because most of it around there is limestone. And then you've got this little outcrop where the town is, Roussillon, that's red. It's ochre, and they buy ochre there.

[2:27Skip to 2 minutes and 27 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)And so that sense of blood and rust and the physicality of that was - came real for me in a way that, if I just read around it and heard that it was red, wouldn't have felt quite so visceral I think.

[2:33Skip to 2 minutes and 33 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: OK interesting, because you see that in the novel, with the kind of the red dust under their feet as they're walking along. Was it important to you as well to get what these different settings, these backdrops, do to the character, as well as them being the way they look in a kind of objective sense? Because you've got that particularly in Paris. You get the sense in which he's kind of walking down the road, and it's almost as though he's got different versions of Paris in front of him. When he gets to Roussillon, and he gets into that house, and suddenly space seems to kind of open up, and he feels much more free to write.

[3:06Skip to 3 minutes and 6 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: Yeah, I think place only matters insofar as it - you know, it matters. In terms of writing, obviously - when one's writing, the setting matters on an emotional level.

[3:22Skip to 3 minutes and 22 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)It only matters if it matters to the characters. And I suppose it was about finding those ways in which place shifts mood and shapes the self. And I'm happy to hear you talk about Paris and the overlaying of the versions. And the sense - he sort of - he get glimpses of the pre-war Paris when he's on the underground, say, or I think he sort of reflects that it's - you see Paris in reflections, now, like in the river, rather than in the physical buildings. So I suppose in that way, he's kind of enacting my own thoughts about it, which is that it's kind of an imagined place.

[4:05Skip to 4 minutes and 5 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)And it's - when they go back to Paris, are they going back to their Paris? You know, Paris has changed. And it's all about the individual or the social response to the place, rather than the actual inherent nature of the place itself. The fact that it's blood and rust in the soil is as much about the nature - decay and violence, as it is about geography.

[4:33Skip to 4 minutes and 33 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: And also, when they get to Paris, all the scenes we see in Paris, seems to be so much about - it's about the way people look, and it's what food cafes might serve. That's how we get a sense of how far on the occupation has gone. And then when he goes back to Paris and he has a look at it, and she eats those pears really hungrily, really greedily, but he has a look, and he thinks, you're just kind of skin and bones. It's really about - it's about food, and how people look, it's less about street names and forests and that kind of thing, I thought.

[4:58Skip to 4 minutes and 58 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: Yeah, and I'm fascinated, I think, by how you respond to dearth. That became really important, that sort of sense of how the body is worn down by these experiences and how relationships are worn down by these experiences. And just the sort of the detail of the physicality of things, like when she eats those pears, I'm very invested in the pear-iness of the pear. And the experience of that to someone who's been getting by on things that are so basic, and so, sort of-- can you say drab with food? So utilitarian, so sort of just calories, we need calories, we need carbs, we need, you know, that's fat, we'll have that.

[5:47Skip to 5 minutes and 47 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)Trying to get by on that kind of basic level. And the idea of the luxury of a pear, because pears are really luxurious if you get a good one. And so yes, that, for me, was a real moment of a sort of cusp being turned as well. That's as things begin to get better, really, I think. And if there can be pears, if there can be a bag full of pears, then maybe we're moving into a better phase again.

[6:14Skip to 6 minutes and 14 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: Yeah, and also when he's over in Ireland towards the end, and he's desperate to get back to Paris, and the milk and the cake seem to sort of curdle in his mouth. He thinks, I can't really handle this.

[6:24Skip to 6 minutes and 24 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: Yeah, it begins to sort of move towards research, I suppose, when I talk about this, because this has to do with reading around what's going on in neutral Ireland around the times, historically, and also reading some of the fiction that came out of that time. And Elizabeth Bowen has some wonderful short stories that move between England and Ireland during the war, and I think to some degree, channelling her a little bit in those afternoon tea parties where someone's adrift from war-battered England in what feels like a very - like an island, as well as Ireland. It's a sort of - again that's a kind of - it's remained a kind of bubble.

[7:22Skip to 7 minutes and 22 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)It's not that it's been without impact, and lots of people left on and joined up and were involved, and there were - and in the north we suffered dreadfully from the Blitz, but there was also a sense of ease there, which is making people who'd come from elsewhere feel very uneasy, I think. And that was the kind of mood that I picked up from her stories.

[7:31Skip to 7 minutes and 31 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: With Beckett himself, I mean, how was it to create this fictionalised version of him? Did you feel quite honor-bound to create a very realistic version of him, or did you give yourself freer rein than that?

[7:43Skip to 7 minutes and 43 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: Bound is an interesting word, because restraint was a thing I felt for a very long time. And what happened was, I discovered I could manage to write the entire novel without naming him. So sometimes there's a bit of a play with pronouns going on in order to achieve this, but essentially, having realised that I could get away without naming him, and I would, and I did - well, if you think I got away with it, I certainly attempted to, that was my technique. And suddenly, I no longer had to call him Sam or Samuel or Beckett or whatever, a whole sort of layer of reserve dropped away, which has to do with my admiration and fan-girl quality going on.

[8:27Skip to 8 minutes and 27 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)And I was able to - I could sort of leave that to one side to some degree. I just kind of perched on his shoulder. And what I tried to do, whether I achieved or not is another question, but what I tried to do, was to bring what he - what I knew from the biographies, what I knew from the letters, what I knew from the later work that he wrote about - that sort of references his childhood, that brings in childhood images, and weave all that, so his own writing, other people's writing about him.

[9:05Skip to 9 minutes and 5 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)I was able to find out what exhibits he went to see, things like that. So bringing in some of those sensory impressions from all over, and trying to feed those through his - what's ticking over in his head as he's experiencing the world as we follow him.

[9:25Skip to 9 minutes and 25 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: What did you think about the kind of character, or the version of him you've created? Because he's sort of - he's really courageous, when you think about the things he does during the war. He's courageous but also kind of generous - he'll give up his rations for the wife of his friend who's gone away, and he'll - he could have gone back to Ireland at any point - well, at many early points. He could've just gone back and gone, I'll sit in the garden with my mum and drink tea. But he doesn't. He goes through this. What do you think about him?

[9:52Skip to 9 minutes and 52 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: Well the thing is, he didn't have to go back at all. He could have just stayed in Ireland. He didn't have to face any of it. And it was that series of extraordinary decisions, becoming aware of how they racked up, one after the other, from going back to, as you say, giving his rations up when he's already just on subsistence rations himself, to then deciding to join the resistance when he's not, frankly, a practical man. The work he gets suits him. And that continues, extraordinary decision after extraordinary decision. I think he's an extraordinary man. I mean, I already admired the work, but as I found out more about the biography I increasingly admired the man.

[10:42Skip to 10 minutes and 42 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)And I think often, people who maybe know him through his later work think of him as being, himself, as being just incredibly austere.

[10:48Skip to 10 minutes and 48 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: Yeah, kind of miserable.

[10:50Skip to 10 minutes and 50 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: Miserable. But he was apparently, you know, he had a great talent for friendship. He was really good at friendships. Not necessarily good with a big crowd, not necessarily a massive extrovert, but good at being a friend, and he was incredibly generous. And I think, in some ways, I wonder - I don't know if this is just a generally writerly kind of thing or it's specific to him, or - I feel I've got a thread of it in me, too, which is a sense of not really knowing - not really having a sense of self. And maybe that's true of everybody, maybe that's just a human thing, but it's more extreme in him.

[11:32Skip to 11 minutes and 32 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)He doesn't know to take care of himself. And things like giving away his rations, giving away that coat, there's a sense of, like, there isn't a core there to be defended.

[11:45Skip to 11 minutes and 45 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: What's really interesting about that is the way in which, that's all very well when you're on your own and you can kind of give away everything you've got, but when he's with Suzanne, you can see the kind of frustration between the two in the novel. And she's going, I'm not going to not share my bread because you gave all yours away, but I mean just don't do that again, kind of thing.

[12:01Skip to 12 minutes and 1 second](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: Yeah, she's torn as well, because she's - she is well-disposed, she's very political, she's very decent - and I mean that in the strong sense of the word, she's a decent person. But for her there is that more, sort of - like, well, we have to look after ourselves. We have to look after each other.

[12:21Skip to 12 minutes and 21 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: There's also the way in which he seems to be a burden to her a lot of the time. But there's a point where she says, I don't really want you here, but I can't bear the thought of you going away either, is kind of her thought. Sort of, her life would be an awful lot easier, in some ways, if he wasn't there. How important was it for you to bring her into the novel?

[12:38Skip to 12 minutes and 38 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: Oh, very important. As I was saying, she - she's a fascinating person in her own right, very politically committed. And their - they were - essentially, what happened once they were betrayed, the only reason they survived was because she had this network of politically engaged friends who were already working for the resistance, and they were able to scoop them up and put them in safe houses and get them organised to get away. So she was heavily involved politically. She was a talented musician - and they were around each other because of musical interest, so that was a shared passion of theirs.

[13:23Skip to 13 minutes and 23 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)But I think the thing is, she's an extraordinary woman in her own right, but because she's standing next to him, this guy, Samuel Beckett, she kind of fades away, she fades out a bit. She's always going to be plus one on the guest list, and that's a really hard place to be, I think, if you have any ambition or creative energies of your own, to always be next to the person who's doing it in an extraordinary fashion and a world-changing fashion.

[13:53Skip to 13 minutes and 53 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: What about, in terms of people being overshadowed by others, what about the character of James Joyce in this novel? Because you get a sense in which Beckett is haunted by him, he's desperately scrabbling after him a lot of time, he's haunted by him. But Joyce, in this novel, is really - he's quite unthinking, he's also quite ungenerous, in some ways sort of superior, maybe without knowing he's being like that. What do you make of the kind of relation between the two in the novel?

[14:18Skip to 14 minutes and 18 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: This is very much late Joyce. This is very much towards the end of his life, and he's almost entirely lost to sight. He's not a well man. He feels hounded across Europe by war. He's sort of taking the war personally, because it's somewhat overshadowed his publications. He's got burdens, and I think this phase of Beckett's relationship with him is one of realisation.

[14:50Skip to 14 minutes and 50 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)I think what I did really, in relation to the exact timeline of the biography, was I shifted things forward and compacted them a little bit. So for example, the coat that he gives him, which has got a kind of anxiety of influence kind of - it's a big, heavy metaphor of a coat there.

[15:18Skip to 15 minutes and 18 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)That happened before the war, and Beckett had been working with him on Finnegan's Wake and it was - he was working as a secretary - sort of a kind of - at a kind of secretarial role, but with a very sort of- he was working on various aspects of it, really, earlier on, and then into translation of it into French. And he'd expected payment, and he'd expected money, but what he got was some second-hand clothes. He got a coat and some ties. And so I had to bring that in to this phase, because it was such a clear sense of how that relationship was working. But it had belonged in this part of the story.

[16:05Skip to 16 minutes and 5 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)So I think what's going on here, really, is a realisation of how far that relationship can extend or does extend from Joyce's point of view. What's going on is a necessary severance, really, from both their points of view, as the older man fades into his last months and the younger man takes on his own, you know, shrugs off that coat.

[16:29Skip to 16 minutes and 29 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: Yeah, because he just leaves it behind, doesn't he?

[16:32Skip to 16 minutes and 32 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: He does, he does.

[17:21Skip to 17 minutes and 21 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)And it's his move into becoming the writer he's going to be, having been - if the Gestapo had got him when they came for him, he would be remembered as a minor figure as part of the Joyce circle, but because they got away and because they survived, and because of the transformations that were wrought, or the tempering that was done in that crucible of occupation and war, he became the writer he was he was going to be, that he was able to step aside from, or shrug off Joyce's influence and his style, which is quite - I feel quite dominates his early work, and then move into the later phase that we sort of tend to think of as being Beckettian.

[17:28Skip to 17 minutes and 28 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: Yeah, absolutely, yeah. I mean, on that, the style of your novel was really, really interesting. And it does feel kind of Beckettian in a lot of senses. How was that to do? I presume that was intentional, but how - is it the same thing, where you didn't mention Beckett by name, therefore, well, it's a bit of that style but not entirely. How did it feel to write that?

[17:51Skip to 17 minutes and 51 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: It emerged, it evolved. The key thing for me was, I have a kind of antipathy to trying to parody or pastiche or - I feared that if I try and write like someone, that's where it'll end up. And I think that's disrespectful and I don't want to do that. And also I wanted to create a world that was very physical, as is his, of course. His work, as well because of the evolution, the paring away, the down to bare bones into silence, I couldn't follow him that far, but I could nod to his phrasings and his rhythms and sort of notice some of the things that he often noticed in his work.

[18:50Skip to 18 minutes and 50 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: What's interesting is the way in which he finds a part to play, and quite an important one to play, but it's also about language as well. It's about words, it's about piecing things together. You know - he's sort of pushing around these little strips of paper with his hand, trying to find the code. So it's kind of interesting with the way in which language infiltrates that part of his life as well.

[19:06Skip to 19 minutes and 6 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: Yes, yes, I love that. When I found out what his work was, and obviously this is a slow accretion of information over time, some of it before I began the novel, some of it after I began the novel. But discovering what Beckett's work during his time in Paris in the resistance was, and this gathering up of these slips of paper, the distilling stuff down to the essence, and then that itself being photographed to microfilm and making it smaller, I mean it's just that sense of everything being brought back down to its barest bones and its smallest state and the tiniest of stains upon silence, as it were. And that just felt utterly perfect for him.

[19:55Skip to 19 minutes and 55 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: Yeah, and also the way in which words or sentences or phrases don't really seem to refer to anything in the world around them, you know? IT's sort of - he's getting the slips of paper, what the hell does that refer to? And the same way, you can see that in later work.

[20:05Skip to 20 minutes and 5 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: Yes, and also the way that that can then kind of - you send that somewhere else. The words can be so powerful. You don't necessarily know what they mean, but you plant them in someone else's head and they start to have this other, this transformational effect that can then change the world, whether that's something like Mein Kampf or his own report that was sent back to England and then bombing raids happened as a result. So you have this sense of like - maps can be redrawn and places physically changed just by the impact of words.

[20:43Skip to 20 minutes and 43 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: Where do you feel the narrative "I" is, or the kind of central consciousness, because we don't see other people unless Beckett is also there, I don't think. Maybe we do. So is it kind of free and direct style in that way, are we following him around, but it's also in the third person, so where is it?

[20:59Skip to 20 minutes and 59 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: So for me, I'd just come from Longbourn, and I don't know if you - you know Longbourn? A book that was telling a story that was parallel to Austen's. So in that one, I move - I do the free and direct style, and I quite happily just land on someone else's shoulder and drift into their thoughts and drift out again and then fly away and land on someone else's shoulder. That's the kind of freedom that Austen's style can give you. Beckett was a big Austen fan as well. So it was quite nice to take just a shred of that technique, and I'm mostly on his shoulder, and I'm mostly dipping into his thoughts.

[21:36Skip to 21 minutes and 36 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)And there's plenty of people that we don't enter the thoughts of. Like I don't go into - Joyce is just from the outside. But I do dip into Suzanne, from her point of view, and I do dip into his mother's point of view. And as far as I recall, those are just the three. And it's a little bit cheeky, because that was just what I allowed myself, because I did want - it is his story, but those two other figures in there are so key to it, and they do, I think, need to be able to give a moment of him from outside, that we see how he's seen and how he's loved.

[22:23Skip to 22 minutes and 23 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: What about the way in which those scenes - and it's more towards the end, but those scenes when he's sitting down to write and suddenly the world seems to open up. He talks to kind of Anna Beamish about it and she says, we're writers, we don't feel comfortable unless we're writing and all rest of it, and then finally he kind of, it starts to flow again. How was it to write about a writer writing? What was that like?

[22:45Skip to 22 minutes and 45 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: I don't think it's a great idea to write about writers, because writers write about writing because that's what they do every day, so unless you are managing to get out and do other stuff as well, it's a bit of an easy out. But for him, I think there's a real ethical thing going on there, about what it is to write at times of massive change and violence and suffering, and what it is to express some kind of inner self. What's the point of this romantic notion, if we have that romantic notion, the sense of expressing an inner self, a creativity, of fulfilling that, when all across Europe people are being murdered? What's the point?

[23:43Skip to 23 minutes and 43 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)And yet it is done and it has to be done. And he needs to do it. And the stuff that he produces, ultimately, is transformational and it is fighting against that kind of brutality, and it's expressing humanity and something of the extraordinary nature of the human spirit and endurance and love. And to do that when the world is collapsing around you and is full of brutality and horrors, although he's really struggling with the point of it, it is absolutely the point.

[24:32Skip to 24 minutes and 32 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)This is the kind of stuff - you know, I'm watching what's going on in the world around me as I'm writing this novel and having these same kinds of questions about what is the point of this stuff, me sitting in the corner of a cafe for three hours with one coffee and making stuff up while the world burns? And yet, it kind of has to be done. I'm not putting myself in any way alongside him with this, but just there is a kind of - there's an inherent need in him to do this. And there is also a extraordinary ultimate effect from it. So it is ultimately worthwhile.

[25:13Skip to 25 minutes and 13 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)And I think that is the kind of discussion that if you're in any way ethically engaged, writers do have all the time, but for him, it, I think, was, that period was transformational in that process. And I do have - he and Miss Beamish have this conversation there, where he says it just seems kind of wrong, ethically suspect, I think he says. And she says, well, it's like, snails make slime. You just do it. It eases you through the world.

[25:36Skip to 25 minutes and 36 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)ALEX: OK, well I think we've covered most of what I wanted to talk about. So yeah, thanks very much.

[25:40Skip to 25 minutes and 40 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185680#)JO: Thank you. It's been a real pleasure.
