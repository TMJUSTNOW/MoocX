# From dialogue to setting[** View284 comments](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/225546#fl-comments)

This week we’ve covered a range of issues regarding the presentation of conversations in fictional narrative.

- We have considered what is revealed by the way a character talks and interacts in conversation.
- And we’ve looked closely at the various effects of introducing dialect voices into a novel.
- Finally, we’ve considered a range of examples of dialogue from Eimear McBride’s *The Lesser Bohemians*, and considered some of the effects generated.

Next week, we’ll be turning to the issue of setting, and considering why authors might choose particular locations for their novels. We’ll also be looking at a range of examples from Jo Baker’s novel *A Country Road, A Tree*.

It's one of the questions people ask first. And this issue of location is also a key consideration for any author when they sit down to write their novel. Where should their characters live? Where should the story take place? This is a pretty central concern and something that we as readers will notice very early on. But we also need to consider some important questions when it comes to thinking about a novel's location. In what way and to what extent is a particular sense of place being conjured up?

This tends to be the case for murder mysteries. Think here of Rebus's Edinburgh or Inspector Morse's Oxford. Or, even if the particulars of a city are referred to directly, such as its landmarks, streets, and pubs, is it still important that this is a New York novel say, or takes place in north-west London? This final week, we'll introduce you to some of the ways in which a novel's setting can have a direct impact on its characters and plot.
