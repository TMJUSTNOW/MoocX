A first-person narrator (the “I” perspective) isn’t able to enter other characters’ heads - just as in real life we don’t know exactly what other people are thinking.

A first-person narrator is likely to be biased, and therefore present a subjective opinion rather than an objective rendering of events. This is particularly the case if the narrator doesn’t like another person, for instance, or has good reason to defend his or her own actions. If the narrator is personally involved in the story they’re telling, it’s very likely that their narrative will be unreliable.

The narrator might withhold information about the reader if he or she has cause to be wary about his or her own past behaviour, or wishes to protect another character by lying to us about what he or she knows. Sometimes a narrator simply does not know enough about the events described, and this means their version is unreliable. We often see this with child narrators, who might witness something, but are too young to be able to understand it.

## Question 3

Which of the following is a useful way of judging character?

**Their way of speaking.

**Their clothes and hair.

**Their name.

**Their behaviour.

**Another character’s assessment of them.

Anaswer all the above



## Question 4

Stream of consciousness writing aims to recreate the flow of a character’s mind.

True/False

Answer - True

This type of writing wants to give the impression that the reader is eavesdropping on the flow of experience in a character’s mind - it attempts to be the textual presentation of an imagined thought-stream.[](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185494/questions/3)
