# Which book do you think should win?

The [James Tait Black Prizes](http://www.ed.ac.uk/events/james-tait-black/about/book) have several categories, including two for books - fiction and biography.

These prizes are Britain’s oldest literary awards. Founded in 1919 by Janet Coats, the widow of publisher James Tait Black, the prizes commemorate her husband’s love of good books. Each prize is worth £10,000.

### The shortlisted novels for the fiction prize

The four contemporary novels featured in this course were selected for the shortlist in May 2017, and the awards ceremony will take place as part of the Edinburgh International Book Festival in August 2017.
