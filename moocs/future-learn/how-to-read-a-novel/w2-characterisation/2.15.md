Watch an interview with Garth Greenwell where he reflects on his experience of writing the novel. Among other aspects he talks about how he sees the relationship between the narrator and Mitko, the setting of Sofia, and the novel’s style.

If you are short of time, we’ve recommended a few highlights:

Greenwell begins by discussing the first-person narrative style of the novel, and he later describes how he thinks this links to the novel’s main themes:

> (9:39) the deepest thematic of the book and the deepest dilemma the book wants to interrogate or explore… is the fact that we are locked in our consciousnesses, that we have no unmediated, no immediate access to another person’s consciousness, which means that **we can never be sure if we’re really in the same story with another person**. And again, that’s maybe kind of obviously true in this relationship between these two people who meet in a cruising bathroom and whose relationship is structured by transaction. But I think that’s also true of any human relationship. And I think that’s equally true of two people who have been married for thirty years, that that is just the fundamental condition of human life, to not have omniscience, to not be able to see everything.

Despite this first-person narrative, however, Greenwell explains that he wanted Mitko (not the unnamed narrator) to be “the most vibrant, the most vivid presence on the page.” Greenwell goes on to call this an “ethical question”, explaining that:

> ( 1:06) it was really important to me that the reader never forget that, **even though we only have one consciousness on the page, that there is another consciousness experiencing this story**. And so I try to give the reader enough information to be reminded that there is another human person experiencing this story, and also that that human person’s experience might be different from how the narrator interprets it.

Greenwell seems to indicate that the novel’s narrator is unreliable, and that we can’t entirely trust his version, or his understanding, of events. *What Belongs to You* has been described by some as the “next great gay novel” - and in this interview Greenwell discusses the influence that James Baldwin’s novel *Giovanni’s Room* had on his work (you can read more on the links between the two novels in [this article on Baldwin by Greenwell](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/19/james-baldwin-giovannis-room-garth-greenwell-60th-anniversary-gay-novel)). Greenwell seems to link certain aspects of the narrator’s unreliability with the narrator’s experience of growing up in an environment “where queer people are taught that their lives lack value and their lives lack dignity”:

> (11:46) It wasn’t until I was deep into it that I realised that **there are these odd things about the narrator**, especially in the first section, a way in which **he’s sort of claiming to tell us everything while clearly hiding behind lots of defences**, and ways that **he’s desperate for connection and yet also clearly holding the world at arm’s length**. And I guess I think what that middle section is doing is sort of trying to see where - or trying to sort of understand where this narrator learned certain lessons about himself. And you know, that section is also set in Kentucky. It’s set in the ’80s and ’90s, when this narrator is a kid coming of age in Kentucky. And I didn’t understand, again until I had written that section, that I think maybe the spark of this novel was this weird kind of vertiginous experience I kept having living in this very foreign place, Bulgaria, of being reminded of the place where I grew up, which was Kentucky in the early ’90s. And I think what a lot of those points of connection had to do with were the fact that these are both places where queer people are taught certain lessons about their lives, where queer people are taught that their lives lack value and their lives lack dignity.

Can you think of other novels where our view of the narrator (and of the trustworthiness of their point of view) changes as we learn more about them?

[0:07Skip to 0 minutes and 7 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)ALEX: I want to kick off by talking about characterisation in the novel, because obviously the first couple of pages, really about by page two, we've got a real kind of sense of Mitko and the way he looks and his kind of general demeanour and stuff. And I just wonder if you can give a sense of how important it was to get those details in the frame kind of early on in the novel?

[0:29Skip to 0 minutes and 29 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)GARTH: Yeah. I mean, kind of the first thing I knew about the novel was point of view. I knew that we were going to be deep in this first-person point of view. And I knew that there was never going to be a point in the novel where we were going to have a shift of point of view, or where Mitko's sort of consciousness was put on the page. But it was also, I knew from the beginning, that this was a story with two central characters. And it was really important for me that Mitko, even though we don't have access to his consciousness, that he be, I hope, kind of the most vibrant, the most vivid presence on the page.

[1:06Skip to 1 minute and 6 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)And also, I mean there was a kind of - and this is both a craft question and then, as is often the case, kind of an ethical question too - it was really important to me that the reader never forget that, even though we only have one consciousness on the page, that there is another consciousness experiencing this story. And so trying to give the reader enough information to be reminded that there is another human person experiencing this story, and also that that human person's experience might be different from how the narrator interprets it.

[1:44Skip to 1 minute and 44 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)And so that meant kind of really detailed physical descriptions, but not just how Mitko looks, but also like how he moves, how he physically responds to the narrator.

[1:55Skip to 1 minute and 55 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)ALEX: Yeah, because I noticed that a lot. I mean, there are certain tics that seem to crop up over and over again, like his kind of obsession with personal hygiene, which seems slightly curious given his profession - also the fact he's probably homeless or might well be homeless. But also cleaning the narrator's sort of computer equipment and stuff like that, and also being really kind of fastidious about choosing the right bottle in the bottle shop, and always ordering too much food, you know, these kind of tics seem to occur again and again. I wonder if that's - I mean, obviously that's really, really conscious. But how important it is that to give us a sense of him?

[2:28Skip to 2 minutes and 28 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)GARTH: I mean, I guess I think it's important. I should say that this novel was the first fiction I'd ever written. And I wrote it in a very intuitive way. My literary training was as a poet. And so I had never - it's not as though I was kind of consciously thinking about characterisation in a craft way as I was writing. I was really feeling my way forward sentence by sentence. But it was important to me that this character be an individual and not an idea. I did want to give him characteristics that push against maybe a kind of stereotyped notion of what an individual like this, or an individual that's encountered in these sorts of places, might be.

[3:17Skip to 3 minutes and 17 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)Those patternings, I mean those tics and patterns, do engage with the kind of thematic preoccupations of the book. I mean, the book is interested in the ways in which sort of cleanliness and dirtiness are part and parcel of the rhetoric of shame, or the way that Mitko always orders more food than he can eat, that kind of suggestion of an unappeasable hunger. I hope that those are bound together with sort of those preoccupations as well.

[3:51Skip to 3 minutes and 51 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)ALEX: Yeah, interesting, yeah. I mean, there's also a sense in which, although Mitko treats the narrator pretty badly, he cant't, he can never quite let him go. He always allows him back in - well, until the end really, allows him back into the house and will give him more money and give him food and all the rest of it. I mean, is that something to do with shame about he's an American, he's gone over there, and he seems to have more money than someone who's actually from there, and he's got a good job and Mitko looks around and thinks, god, do you own all this? Is this your apartment? Is this your computer and all the rest of it?

[4:18Skip to 4 minutes and 18 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)So is it, is it sort of shame about relative affluence, or is it more kind of straightforward just attraction and why not let this person back into your life? What do you think?

[4:26Skip to 4 minutes and 26 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)GARTH: I mean, that's a complicated question, and I'm not sure that I'm really qualified to answer it. I mean, late in the book the narrator does meditate on kind of what our obligations are to others, and the way in which, sort of depending on in what light those obligations are seen, it can seem like we don't owe anybody anything, or it can seem like we owe more than we could ever pay. And both of those perspectives seem kind of true to this narrator. I hope that the book does face head on the complications of a relationship across the sort of gulfs of privilege that exist between the narrator and Mitko.

[5:15Skip to 5 minutes and 15 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)I hope it doesn't shy away from the ethical dilemmas of those things. I also hope that it doesn't suggest that those gulfs prevent a kind of genuine human connection and a kind of genuinely complicated relationship. I think both of these characters at times treat each other badly. I think they both kind of fail each other at times. And yet, in my own reading of this book, which is of course only one reading, it is a love story. I mean, it's a strange and a strained love story, but it is a love story.

[5:47Skip to 5 minutes and 47 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)And there are moments between these two characters that to me seem genuinely intimate and warm and full of a kind of feeling that overflows the bounds of the transaction that structures their relationship, so that when Mitko says to the narrator, as he does at a couple of points - he says, you are an "istinski priyatel," you are a true friend - I would say that sort of the narrator's tolerance for the kind of humiliation that Mitko sometimes makes him feel, I guess in my - it is bound up with those questions of class.

[6:25Skip to 6 minutes and 25 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)But I guess, to me, it's more bound up with the book's meditation on desire, and the book's meditation on desire as not something we choose, like we don't get to choose what we desire, instead desire is something that happens to us, and a sense in which, I mean that sense of humiliation or that sense of a kind of unwilled nature of desire is obviously more present and painful when what one desires is not what one is supposed to desire. And therefore, I think that those questions are sort of seen through the particular lens of queer desire in this book.

[7:08Skip to 7 minutes and 8 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)But - I guess I do think that that's a kind of, a sort of universal quality of desire, that it disorders, that it sort of breaks all our good intentions, our best laid plans, that there is something kind of inherently humiliating in desire, because it's something we are subjected to.

[7:30Skip to 7 minutes and 30 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)ALEX: Obviously it's very clear that he's the only one named, the only one of his kind of previous relationships. How important is it that it's told from this sort of reconstituted memory, and therefore Mitko still seems to be the most important one there, even though - I'm not sure how much time has moved on by this stage. How important is it that this is in the past? And also, surely there must be some doubts about the accuracy of it, because it's through memory.

[7:55Skip to 7 minutes and 55 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)GARTH: Well, I would say that the sort of doubts of the accuracy have less to do with memory and the question of the point of telling than they do with just the sort of condition of the first-person narrator, and the fact that the narrator is constantly interpreting things through his particular set of limitations. In that sense, I don't think this narrator is an unreliable narrator in the sense that he's trying to deceive us or trying to deceive himself. I mean, actually I think he's trying very hard to tell the truth, but he is limited in all sorts of ways that I think should call into question his judgement. It is important that it's a retrospective narrative.

[8:35Skip to 8 minutes and 35 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)I mean, what interests me in the story is not really the kind of cause and effect of linear plot. It's instead this sort of drama of someone trying to make sense of their life and someone trying to make sense of their experience. There's a way in which the novel does have a kind of lyric approach to time, in the sense that kind of from the very first sentence of the novel, the whole relationship is available, the whole story from beginning to end is available.

[9:09Skip to 9 minutes and 9 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)And that, it does feel important that the narrator is able to sort of cast forward and cast back and think about the implications of what's happening, not just be caught up in kind of the mechanics of plot.

[9:22Skip to 9 minutes and 22 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)ALEX: I think he's kind of brutally honest as a narrator, actually. And you're right, he does seem to try to - it's kind of warts and all, in a lot of senses. But because he's a first-person narrator, there are always going to be doubts about the accuracy, because you're only ever in your own head. And so everything else is just pure conjecture, really, isn't it?

[9:39Skip to 9 minutes and 39 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)GARTH: Which I do think is kind of the deepest thematic of the book and kind of the deepest dilemma the book wants to interrogate or explore, which is the fact that we are locked in our consciousnesses, that we have no unmediated, no immediate access to another person's consciousness, which means that we can never be sure if we're really in the same story with another person. And again, that's maybe kind of obviously true in this relationship between these two people who meet in a cruising bathroom and whose relationship is structured by transaction. But I think that's also true of any human relationship.

[10:16Skip to 10 minutes and 16 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)And I think that's kind of equally true of two people who have been married for thirty years, that that is just the kind of fundamental condition of human life, to not have omniscience, to not be able to see everything. And I do hope very much that my narrator kind of is - I mean, I think the sort of arc of the book, the kind of emotional arc of the book, is the narrator being forced to confront unpleasant truths about himself.

[10:45Skip to 10 minutes and 45 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)ALEX: And do you think that that middle section, "A Grave," is kind of fundamental to this, because what's brilliant about that, is it's sort of - he gets the letter from his father - about his father - and then it's a sort of - he walks through the city, finds himself in a part of the city he didn't really kind of know before, doesn't really recognise. But while he walks through, it's a kind of stream consciousness in the way it works. And it's a kind of floating back into past experiences. I mean, how important do you think that middle section is to giving us a full understanding of the narrator?

[11:15Skip to 11 minutes and 15 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)GARTH: To me, it's really crucial. I mean, to me, it is kind of the most important section of the book. You know, it's a difficult section. It was really difficult to write. And again, I wrote it without a plan. I mean, that section, when I finished the first section of the novel, I was not thinking of it as a novel. I thought it was a kind of complete story. The second section really did feel like something that kind of happened to me, I mean something that kind of seized me.

[11:46Skip to 11 minutes and 46 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)And it wasn't until I was deep into it that I realised that there are these odd things about the narrator, especially in the first section, a way in which he's sort of claiming to tell us everything while clearly hiding behind lots of defences, and ways that he's desperate for connection and yet also clearly holding the world at arm's length. And I guess I think what that middle section is doing is sort of trying to see where-- or trying to sort of understand where this narrator learned certain lessons about himself. And you know, that section is also set in Kentucky. It's set in the '80s and '90s, when this narrator is a kid coming of age in Kentucky.

[12:38Skip to 12 minutes and 38 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)And I didn't understand, again until I had written that section, that I think maybe the spark of this novel was this weird kind of vertiginous experience I kept having living in this very foreign place, Bulgaria, of being reminded of the place where I grew up, which was Kentucky in the early '90s. And I think what a lot of those points of connection had to do with were the fact that these are both places where queer people are taught certain lessons about their lives, where queer people are taught that their lives lack value and their lives lack dignity.

[13:15Skip to 13 minutes and 15 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)And I think one of the things the book is exploring - although again, I would not have been able to articulate this while I was writing it. One of the things the book was exploring was sort of the consequences of having been taught to associate desire with exclusion. And I guess, I do think this is one way in which the book is exploring what we might call queer subjectivity in a way that's different from earlier queer books, even though it uses a lot of tropes that are familiar from queer literature, like the exploration of shame, the association of queer sexuality with illness.

[13:53Skip to 13 minutes and 53 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)You know, the shame in the book I think is fundamentally different from the shame in a book like James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room, which is a book I owe a great deal and a book to which my own book is indebted in many ways. But you know, the narrator of that book, David, is kind of obsessed with trying to understand why he's gay. He's obsessed with trying to not be gay. He has disastrous relationships with women. There's a way in which he is desperate not to be gay. And my narrator feels none of that.

[14:27Skip to 14 minutes and 27 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)I mean, my narrator is in fact an out and proud gay man, and an out and proud gay man in a place where that's quite difficult. I mean, he's someone who for decades has been steeped in a language of queer activism and queer liberation. He knows that the lessons he was taught about himself as a child were false lessons, that they're bankrupt lessons. But they are still lessons that shape him. He will never get to be someone who was not taught those lessons. And so thinking about that, about what it means to sort of still be shaped by a shame one has rejected, that seemed to me interesting.

[15:08Skip to 15 minutes and 8 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)It was a way of kind of inhabiting the sort of inherited forms of queer literature and hopefully renovating them and changing them and making them reflect on not just a queer past, which I hope my book does reflect on, but also a queer present.

[15:26Skip to 15 minutes and 26 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)ALEX: What about the kind of Bulgarian setting here, or Sofia in particular, because for instance, him and Mitko at one point look onto the street. And if I remember this correctly, there's a suggestion which the street has never been named. And there's a whole kind of - a lot he's walking around. And it might be there, but it also might be somewhere else, because although a couple of landmarks are named, it's a kind of shadowy, vague description of the city. How important was it to get a sense that this was about the narrator's own experience of the city, rather than the city in and of itself?

[16:01Skip to 16 minutes and 1 second](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)GARTH: Well, I think it's very, I think it very much is that. I'll say, though, that I hope that - I hope that the city kind of isn't actually shadowy and vague in the novel. You know, there's not a kind of omniscient, sweeping, I would say kind of touristic overview of the city. This is a book about a foreigner. I mean, this is a book about an American abroad. But it's not a book about the tourist. The kind of detailed, I hope vivid, descriptions that we get are of things like the inside of the bus as he's going around the city, or the inside of a medical clinic. I wanted to give a kind of intimate view of the city.

[16:39Skip to 16 minutes and 39 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)I wanted very much to avoid any kind of exoticised representation of sort of, you know, "the Orient." I mean, to me, Sofia is at once an extraordinarily special place, a place that's extraordinarily dear to me. And then it is also a place like any other, by which I mean a place that is sort of full of a human value that is infinite. One of the sort of implicit arguments that the book makes is that these are places we should write novels about, that these are places that are just as deserving of that peculiar dignity that is bestowed by the literary imagination as the sort of twilit skies over Paris.

[17:29Skip to 17 minutes and 29 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)My most fundamental, my central belief about literature is that literature is a way of looking, that it's not a matter of kind of exotic locales or big events, but instead about the quality and I would say really kind of the ethical pitch of attention that you turn on a subject.

[17:50Skip to 17 minutes and 50 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)ALEX: What about the idea of a sort of language barrier? I mean, near the start, there seems to be a language barrier between him and Mitko, and that, it doesn't seem to hamper the relationship, but it does put it on in a kind of different setting than later on, when he seems to kind of understand much more of what's going on. How do you think language works? And also, the sense in which we're also removed from Mitko, and indeed anyone else the narrator talks to, because of the absence of direct speech. So it's all from what the narrator thinks. So we're at kind of several layers of remove here. How important was that to build in?

[18:22Skip to 18 minutes and 22 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)GARTH: Well, I mean, the central project of the novel I think is to put consciousness on the page, to try to put on the page the experience of thinking. And you know, part of that involved not giving us that like really extraordinarily false and artificial realist convention of direct speech, which of course has nothing to do with how people actually talk. I should say I love novels that do dialogue really well. I mean, I love that. It's a wonderful effect. I love the sort of quick-talking comedies of Hollywood in the 1920s and '30s. Like that's all great. It has nothing to do with how we actually talk. There's nothing realistic about it.

[19:12Skip to 19 minutes and 12 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)And instead, what was interesting to me was sort of the narrator processing it and giving us that speech, but giving it to us sort of processed as he's taking it in. I mean, part of that is also the fact that I'm sort of obsessed with that peculiar space of consciousness that is speaking a language inexpertly, I mean, when one is kind of between two languages, that kind of constant transaction between languages, the ways in which he has to sort of think back and try to reconstitute and he's not entirely catching what the other person is saying. I mean, all of that is about putting us deep in this narrator's consciousness.

[19:53Skip to 19 minutes and 53 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)And then it's also I think - I think Bulgarian is central to the book. I think it's central to what happens between the narrator and Mitko. This is a narrator, as we've said, his central understanding of his life is structured around shame. And I think one of the defences he has found against that shame is language. And there's a particular relationship to language, a particular relationship to elegance in language, to a kind of mastery in language, in his native language, that that is all a kind of - I think a certain use of language for him represents dignity and is a kind of defence he has erected against the world and against other people.

[20:36Skip to 20 minutes and 36 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)And Mitko takes that away from him, because with Mitko, he has to speak Bulgarian. He has to speak this language he speaks like a child. And I think that takes away from him almost all of his defences. And that's part of what allows this relationship to de-stabilize him in the way that it does. I mean, in the very first scene, it takes away his name. One of the reasons the narrator is unnamed in the book is because in that first scene he tells Mitko his name, and Mitko can't pronounce it, because it's unpronounceable in Bulgarian.

[21:09Skip to 21 minutes and 9 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)Like that felt really important, that sort of, you know, he is in this foreign territory, where all the usual landmarks, all the usual defences have been stripped from him.

[21:23Skip to 21 minutes and 23 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)ALEX: Does that feed into the kind of tone of the novel, do you think? - because I guess there is an enormous amount of anguish here, both in the past and in the kind of the present time in the novel and his relationship with Mitko. But it feels kind of consciously, purposely, kind of muted in a way. It's almost like a kind of silent scream - because there's mortification, there's anguish - and yet, he doesn't speak as though he's kind of breaking down at any point. But it's very clear he is. Is that part of it, do you think?

[21:51Skip to 21 minutes and 51 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)GARTH: Well, I'd say that I am drawn to a kind of aesthetic in which there's a sort of cool surface beneath which - I mean, kind of like a lava plane, you know, that sort of glassy surface, beneath which you know is something extraordinarily hot. I mean, someone who epitomises that aesthetic would be the Greek poet Cavafy. What's interesting then are those moments where that apparent mastery breaks. And I guess, I hope that the style of the book is kind of modulated over the three parts, that in the first section, that that's the section where you do have kind of the coolest texture of the prose.

[22:31Skip to 22 minutes and 31 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)And that then the second section, you know, I think - I mean, to me that feels at times quite hot, you know, and where the narrator's sort of mastery breaks down. I mean, the syntax of that section is very different. There's a way in which a kind of functional syntax breaks down and there are all of these comma splices. And then the third section, in my experience of it, recuperates some of that - you know, that kind of attachment to elegance of the first section, but tempered by that breakdown of the second.

[23:08Skip to 23 minutes and 8 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)You know, I wanted to write a book that had access at once to a kind of coolness, as you say, but also to sort of the heights of lyricism and to really a kind of operatic or aria-like approach to the sentence. I mean, I hope that there are moments in the book of real kind of emotional climax. Often those are moments of intimacy with Mitko in the first section and the third. I mean, I wanted to write those scenes, especially scenes of physical intimacy, with kind of all the extraordinary resources of the English lyric tradition, I mean that tradition which in my training as a poet was really my foundation as a writer.

[24:02Skip to 24 minutes and 2 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)I hope that it's a book that has an interest in sort of the expansive possibilities of English syntax, that has an interest in a Baroque approach to the sentence, which I think is a kind of feature of the novel of consciousness, which is one tradition in which the book is working, and also a feature of queer writing. I mean, whether you're talking about Proust or Thomas Mann or Reinaldo Arenas and Pedro Lemebel, or Thomas Bernhard, that these are writers who are interested in the expressive potential of sort of the shapes of sentences.

[24:35Skip to 24 minutes and 35 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)ALEX: Some parts of it, it reminds me of The Sun Also Rises and Jake in that character, and his sort of clear anguish and heartbreak, and yet there's a kind of cool surface layer. And it's kind of up to the reader a lot of the time to work out that actually underneath his heart is breaking, he can barely go on.

[24:52Skip to 24 minutes and 52 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)GARTH: I'll say, there are lots of ways in which the novel kind of doesn't give us information that novels often give us, not just the narrator's name, but also like why is he in Bulgaria, what his - you know, I mean, the novel just sort of never tells us a lot of that sort of David Copperfield sort of just basic character information. I think again, this wasn't a canny choice. I think a lot of it comes from the fact that my training is in lyric poetry. In lyric poetry, you often just don't care about that. You have an I narrator. And sort of the I narrator is in a particular emotional situation. And you sort of move forward from that.

[25:28Skip to 25 minutes and 28 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)And then part of it comes from, yeah, I do have faith in the reader to do that work. It does seem to me more interesting aesthetically and kind of truer psychologically to try to show changes in emotional temperature through the shape of a sentence, say, rather than through anything the narrator would declare.

[25:47Skip to 25 minutes and 47 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)ALEX: And it's interesting, because you get the sense, the narrator didn't want to be acting in this way. And one imagines that he thinks of himself as a little bit more kind of cosmopolitan and knowing than that. And yet desire strikes, and then suddenly you're kind of - you're not really in control of what you're doing anymore.

[26:00Skip to 26 minutes and 0 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)GARTH: I mean, he's confronted in a way - and I think that this is kind of the deep subject of all American abroad novels - he is confronted with the myths not just of himself, but the extent to which his myths of himself are structured by myths of America. Novels of the American abroad are always novels about America, novels about someone discovering maybe for the first time what it means to be an American. My narrator, he's not like a Hemingway narrator in the sense that he doesn't have those sort of very declarative kind of patriarchal myths about America. But his sense of himself is very centrally structured by American privilege. He's a high school teacher.

[26:42Skip to 26 minutes and 42 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)He doesn't make a lot of money. But he does have a kind of material security and stability that Mitko doesn't have. But much more than that, he has a passport. And that passport means he can leave. And I think the biggest difference between him and Mitko, the biggest sort of difference of privilege, is that for the narrator it is a choice to what extent he's going to bind his destiny to this place and to this person. And for Mitko, of course, it isn't a choice. And that then becomes the kind of big ethical question of the book. It's sort of, what are this narrator's limits of empathy?

[27:20Skip to 27 minutes and 20 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)And you know, I think confronting that for anyone is going to be deeply discomfiting.

[27:26Skip to 27 minutes and 26 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)ALEX: I think that's a good point to end on.

[27:30Skip to 27 minutes and 30 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)GARTH: Great.

[27:30Skip to 27 minutes and 30 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)ALEX: Thanks so much for answering all these questions. That's brilliant.

[27:33Skip to 27 minutes and 33 seconds](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-to-read-a-novel/1/steps/185669#)GARTH: Oh, it was my pleasure. Thank you so much. It was really a privilege to have the conversation. Thank you.
