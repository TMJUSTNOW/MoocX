# From characterisation to dialogue

This week we focused on characterisation, and some of the ways in which a character’s inner thoughts are communicated to the reader.

- We considered how names and first appearances can shape how we feel about a character.
- We also thought about the various advantages of either a first- or a third-person narrator, and what each can convey about consciousness and motive.
- And many of these ideas and techniques were tied to specific examples within Garth Greenwell’s novel.

Next week, we’ll be moving onto the issue of dialogue: we’ll consider how much is revealed when we hear characters talk. And we’ll also be looking at several examples from Eimear McBride’s novel *The Lesser Bohemians*.
