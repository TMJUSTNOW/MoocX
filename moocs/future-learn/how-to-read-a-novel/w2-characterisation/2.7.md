# Stream of consciousness

We looked in week one at a technique called “free indirect style”, whereby a character’s distinctive voice or register infiltrates the ostensibly third-person narration. The character’s voice directs the sentence or passage, giving us access to their thoughts and anxieties but without relinquishing the authority of the narrator. Another way we might gather information about a character, is through a technique called stream of consciousness.

This lacks the mediating presence of a narrator, and instead gives the impression that the reader has direct access to a character’s thought stream, complete with its free associations and only half-formed ideas. Here is an excerpt from “Penelope”, the final chapter of James Joyce’s 1922 novel [*Ulysses*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)), which follows Molly Bloom’s thoughts for 40 or so pages divided into just eight unpunctuated and hypnotic sentences:

> the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him . . .

This is the closest we as readers are ever likely to get to a character: here we are presented not simply with Molly’s words or thoughts, but her barely conscious mind in its pre-verbal state.
