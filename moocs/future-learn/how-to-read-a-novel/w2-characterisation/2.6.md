# First-person narratives

A novel with a first-person narrator, on the other hand, offers a much less complete rendering of consciousness.

This is told from the perspective of one character, whose thoughts we may be privy to, but who is unlikely to shed much useful light on the motives of others – in fact the narrator’s unreliability and misjudgements in this respect are really half the point.

It would be much less believable if that character had a complete and accurate understanding of the thoughts and motives of all the others, so their misreading of some situations renders them more plausible.

This is the case with F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1925 novel [*The Great Gatsby*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby), for instance, when narrator Nick Carraway, armed with only partial knowledge of his mysterious neighbour Gatsby, is forced to rely quite heavily on eye-witness accounts relayed to him by other characters, and still gets some things wrong.

As we saw in the discussion of Joseph Conrad’s [*Heart of Darkness*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness) in week one (step 1.8), a first-person narrator may also come across as secretive or somehow inscrutable, trying to hide something from the reader. But generally speaking this category of narrator offers a way for us to know a lot about one character, while leaving us in the dark, or forced to make certain assumptions, about all of the others.
