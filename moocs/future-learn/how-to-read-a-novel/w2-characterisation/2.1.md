# Introduction to character

This week we’ll be focusing on characterisation. We’ll look at some of the ways in which a character’s inner thoughts are communicated to the reader.

We’ll also consider the various advantages of either a first- or a third-person narrator, and what each can convey about consciousness and motive.

And you’ll be shown ways in which you can apply your knowledge of characterisation to specific examples within contemporary fiction.

In this introductory video, Dr Alex Lawrie outlines the various ways of reading about and understanding character we’ll be looking at throughout this week - such as first appearances, behavioural patterns, and speech.
