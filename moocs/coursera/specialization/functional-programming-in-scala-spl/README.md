##### Instructor: **Martin Odersky**

- [Scala Cheatsheet](https://github.com/lampepfl/progfun-wiki/blob/gh-pages/CheatSheet.md)
- [Twitter Scala School](https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/collections.html)
- [Scala website](http://www.scala-lang.org/)
- Alternatively, [Functional Programming in Scala](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala) by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason is a great alternative/complement to taking this course.
- Get practice with Scala by solving the [99 Scala problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) and the problems of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and [Scala Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/).
