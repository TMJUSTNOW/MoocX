**A. Notes**

- a paradox: coordination produces diversity
- self organization = "patterns at the macro level produced by the interactions of individual agents"

**B. Model 1: Coordination Games**

- in most settings, our actions depend on a combination of personal motivatiosn and desires and social pressures
- pure coordination = everyone gets a payoff if they do the same thing (doesn't matter what the thing is) and nothing if they do different things
- the idea here is that "in some cases, people care more about coordinating on actions than on the actions themselves"
- if one person randomly changes to match another person, the process creates "a random walk with an absorbing barrier"
    - in other words, the process eventually converges

**C. Inefficient Coordination**

- "game theory is now also used to study populations of evolving, adaptive agents who need not be strategic"
