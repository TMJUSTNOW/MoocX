####*Reading 1: Short Primer on Behavioral Economics*

[How Behavioral Economics Differs from Traditional Economics](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/BehavioralEconomics.html)

**A. Introduction**

- the standard economic framework ignores or rules out virtually all the behavior studied by cognitive and social psychologists
- Hebert Simon (1955): maybe agents have "bounded rationality"
    - a more realistic conception of human problem-solving ability
- See Kahneman's many writings on this
    - overconfidence, optimism, extrapolation all defy "rational" thinking
- people are able to act selflessly
    - people respond emotionally in *ultimatum games*

**B. Behavioral Finance**

- "finance is perhaps the branch of economics where behavioral economics has made the greatest contributions"
- financial economics generates sharp, testable predictions abotu observable phenomena
    - i.e. there are lots and lots of data
- closed-end mutual funders are much like typical (open-end) mutual funds, except that to cash out of the fund, investors must sell their shares on the open market
    - market efficiency would say that closed end funds should trade at a price equal to the prices of the underlying securities
    - instead, they trade at a discount most of the time, and premium occasionally
    - "closed-end fund discounts are correlated with one another and appear to reflect individual investor sentiment"
- market efficiency says that stock prices should be unpredictable. But there are some predictions we can make:
    - stocks in general, but especially small-cap, tend to do well in January and on Fridays (but poorly on Mondays)
    - existing of "value firms" that earn higher returns
- people tend to overreact to new information, leading to constant overshoots and "corrections" in asset prices
- people tend to be more likely to sell increasing stocks ("realize gains") than decreasing stocks ("recognize losses"), even though the tax code favors the latter

**C. Saving**

- "although the standard life-cycle model of savings abstracts from both bounded rationality and bounded willpower, saving for retirement is both a difficult cognitive problem and a difficult self-control problem"
- dedicated retirement accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) actually lead to incremental savings, not just a shift of savings
    - potentially because having that dedicated account bolsters people's self-control
    - you've mentally blocked off that account to be explicitly for retirement savings
- however, there has been lower participation in 401(k) plans than expected
    - this is odd, given that the plans essentially represent a cash transfer from the government (and in some cases their employer)
- ODonoghue and Rabin (1999): "Though hyperbolic people will eventually want to participate in the IRAs (because they are patient in the long run), something always comes up in the short run (where they are very impatient) that provides greater immediate reward. Consequently, they may indefinitely delay starting an IRA"
- you might improve participation simply by lowering the "psychic barriers" to participation
    - in most companies, employees who become eligible for the 401(k) plan receive a form inviting them to join.
    - what if you make it a default opt out instead? That puts the burden of work on people who want to LEAVE, and more are likely just to stay in
- great list of resources at the bottom of this

####*Video 5.1 - Thinking Electrons: Modeling People*

**A. Introduction**

- humans are purposeful actors with a diverse set of needs and preferences
- frameworks:
    - Rational (modeling close to ideal)
    - Behavioral (modeling close to reality)
    - Rule Based (no psychology)
- sometimes framework choice matters, sometimes it doesn't

**B. Rational Actor**

- someone is trying to optimize some objective function
    - example OJ: Utility = C^0.5^L^0.5^

**C. Behavioral**

- "behavioral revolution" in economics is recent...but it's been going on in Psychology for 100 years
- neuroscience

####*Video 5.2 - The Rational Actor Model*

**A. How It Works**

- People have an objective
    - optimize toward that objective
- games = "strategic interactions"
    - my choices rely on your choices

**B. Greed**

- does rationality mean selfishness?
    - no not necessarily
    - your objective function is not necessarily "maximize only my own wealth"
- there's nothing intrinsic about rationality that assumes selfish preferences
    - you can of course have altruistic preferences

**C. Decisions vs. Games**

- decision: objective depends only on own action
- game: objective (your payoff) depends on actions of others
- a lot of game theory has you making choices assuming that your opponent will make rational choices

**D. When we Make Optimal Choices**

- large stakes
- it's repeated
- group decisions
- optimal choices can be easy to make

**E. Why Make Rationality Assumptions?**

- it provides a useful benchmark
    - maybe the most important in modeling people
    - it's very unique (testable)
- In practice, using math to find optimal points is easy
- irrationality is not analytically tractable (in all cases)
- even if people make mistakes, if there's no bias rationality might be a good predictor of the mean
- there tend to be places where people systematically deviate from rationality

####*Video 5.3 - Behavioral Models*

**A. Background**

- read *Thinking Fast and Slow*!!! (Kahneman)
- the brain has two processes:
    - a slow, rational one
    - a fast, emotional/intuitive one
- also *Nudge* (Thaler and Sunstein)

**B. Prospect Theory**

- people are risk-averse over gains and risk-loving over losses
    - you would take a sure $400 gain over 50% chance at $1000
    - most, though, also take a 50% chance at $1000 loss over sure $400 loss

**C. Hyperbolic Discounting**

- timing matters
- people would prefer $1000 today to $1005 tomorrow
    - but they would take $1005 in 366 days over $1000 in 365 days
- "we discount the near future more than more distant future"
    - a bias towards instant gratification

**D. Status Quo Bias**

- a systematic bias towards the current state of the world
    - opt-out savings plans have higher participation than opt-in
    - ditto for organ donation

**E. Base Rate Bias**

- "if you ask people to think about one number, then ask a question about something unrelated, the two numbers tend to be close to each other"
- this is weird

**F. Lots of Biases**

- WEIRD = "Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Developed"
    - not sure if the biases hold true across cultures
- people learn!
    - if the stakes are large, people will tend to learn and biases will go away
- some of these biases are very computationally difficult
    - this does not seem like a good reason not to include them in models
- consider starting with rationality, then including biases only if you think they will be very important (not great)
    - this is "rational minus" or "rational plus" modeling

####*Video 5.4 - Rule Based Models*

**A. How it Works**

- assume that people follow some rule or set of rules, see what happens if they do
- "bias"/"optimization" can be rules, but that's not exactly what we're talking about
- fixed vs. adaptive rule-based behavior
- decision context vs. game context

**B. Some Ideas**

- Random choice
    - a good benchmark
- fixed rules may not be optimal
- Moore Machines
    - flow of information between two agents
    - change your state based on other agent's state
- grim trigger = "lock-in"

**C. Adaptive Decisions Rules**

- gradient
    - keep trying things in directions that are working
- random search
    - keep trying different things (not necessarily in one direction)
- Some other adaptive rules:
    - best response
    - mimicry

**D. Observations about Rule-Based Behavior**

- optimal choices could be easy
- simple rules often can get exploited
    - need to define boundaries

**E. Approaches**

- write down the rules
- they're easy to model
- try to capture the main effects
- anything you might right down will be ad hoc
    - it will be influenced by your own behaviors (sample size of 1)
- remember that simple rules can be exploited

####*Video 5.5 - When Does Behavior Matter?*

**A. Does it Matter?**

- how agents act: rationally, behaviorally, according to simple rules

**B. Market Example**

- it might not matter how we model behavior
- if you're fully informed, your behavior will be predictable
- optimizing behavior and simple behavioral behavior might not be very different
- "zero intelligence agents"
    - buyers pick a random amount less than their max
    - sellers pick a random amount more than their min
- with ZIAs, you STILL get a price near the rational or behavioral price
- behavior is not a big deal in markets, but it is in games

**C. Race to the Bottom**

- pick a number in [0,100]
- closest to 2/3 of mean wins
    - rational: pick 0
    - biased: guess 50
    - rule-based: 2/3(50) = 33
- the rule-based stuff, at its limit, leads you to that rational-behavior answer
- people start with a "base rate bias" answer of 50, then start making best response decisions

**D. Two "Rational" People and One Irrational**

- R = (2/5)X
- one irrational person leads to a non-zero answer from the rational people

**E. Takeaway**

- rational behavior, bias, simple rules
    - if the answers are similar, we might say "the answer is invariant to behavior"
- why we model:
    - be more intelligent citizens of the world
    - use and understand data
    - get the logic right
    - design/strategize
