====================================

## Sorting and Peer Effects Introduction

### Models to be covered

- Schelling (Model of Racial Segregation)
- Granovetter (Collective Behaviour)
- Standing Ovation (Peer Effects)
- Identification (On what basis do they act similar)

### Equation Based Models

#### Agent Based Model

- You have individuals
- They have behaviours
- They create outcomes

### Schelling's Spacial Segregation Model

#### Model Determines People Choosing Where To Live

- Racial Segregation
- Income Segregation

This is a threshold based model. So people take actions on the basis of certain conditions to be true

#### Quiz

**Suppose a person's current threshold is 35%, i/e/ she needs at least 35% of her neighbord to be of the same type in order to remain at her location. If a person currently has 4 of 8 neighbors of the same type, how many would have to relocate in order to want to move?**

- (a) 1
- (b) 2
- (c) 3
- (d) 4

**Answer:** (b)

#### Exodus Tip

One person leaves and causes the other to leave as well

#### Genesis Tip

People moving in cause people currently living there to move out


## Measuring Segregation

```
b = # blue in block
B = # blue total (150)
y = # yellow in block
Y = # yellow total (90)

|b/B - y/Y|
```

#### Quiz

**Consider a city consisting of four city blocks of equal population. One block consists of all rich people. One block consists of all poor people, and two consist of half rich and half poor people. What is the index of dissimilarity?**

- (a) 0.25
- (b) 0.33
- (c) 0.5
- (d) 0.75

```
____________
|     |     |
|  R  |  P  |
|_____|_____|
|     |     |
|  RP |  RP |
|_____|_____|

Assuming 10 people per block
Block R  : 1/5 
Block P  : 1/5
Block PR : |1/5 - 1/5| = 0

Total = 1*1/5 + 1*1/5 / 2 
        = 2/10
        = 1/5
        = 0.5
```


**Answer:** (c)


## Peer Effects

### Granovettor's Model

- There are `N` individuals
- Each individual has a Threshold
    - `T_j` for person `j`
    - Join if `T_j` others join

### Quiz

**Suppoe that there are 10 people who have the following thresholds for joining a volunteer project. 2 will volunteer even if no one else does. 6 require 5 others and 2 will volunteer so long as anyone else does. How many people will volunteer total?**

- (a) 4 
- (b) 3
- (c) 10
- (d) 0

**Visualization**

```
1  - True
2  - True
3  - True
4  - True
5  - False
6  - False
7  - False
8  - False
9  - False
10 - False
```

**Answer:** (a)

**Collective action is more likely to happen if**

- Lower thresholds
- More variation in thresholds
    - More people at the low end want to perform an action
    - This causes a cascading effect

### Standing Ovation Model

In this scenario

- Threshold to stand `T`
- Quality `Q`
    - You stand at a certain quality and threshold
- Signal `S = Q + E`
- Initial Rule
    - If `S > T` you Stand
- Subsequent Rule
    - Do you stand if more than `X%` people stand

#### Claim 1

- Higher `Q`, more people stand
- Stand if `Q + Error > T`

#### Claim 2

- Lower `T`, more people stand
- Stand if `Q + Error > T`

#### Claim 3

- Lower `X`, more ovations
- Stand if more than `X%`

**What causes `X` to be big or small?**

Big `X` means if you didnt stand initially, you need to stand a lot of people stand before you do

Small `X` means people who jump on any bandwagon

Signal: `S = Q + E` where `E` is the `Error`

`E = Diversity`  (50 to me could be 65 to you)

**Example**

```
1000 People
T = 60
Q = 50

50 < 60 so people won't stand

E is [-15, +15]

S = 50-15, 50+15
   = 35, 65

E is [-50, +50]
S => 40% will stand up
```

#### Claim 4

If `Q < T`, more variation in `E`, more stand

Stand if `Q + E > T`


- Audience
    - Diverse
    - Unsophisticated
- Performance
    - Multidimentional performance
    - Complex

### Quiz

**If `X%`, the percentage of other you need to stand, is less than 50%, does increasing the noise increase the chance of standing ovation if `Q` is bigger than the threshold?**

- (a) Yes
- (b) No
- (c) Sometimes
- (d) Not enough information

**Work**

```
T < 50
E => 50 
Q > T >= 50

Q + E > T
but
Q is always > T

Which in our case is True
Therefore Q > T (always) and an ovation occurs, regardless of E 
```

**Answer:** (b)

### Ovations Advanced

- Other Factors
    - Location
    - The Theater itself
    - A date
    - Where you are sitting
    - Celebrities in the front
    - Groups of people
    - Academic Performance of the group performing

## Identification Problem

So how do you tell if a group of people is hanging out because of Sorting (homophily - being with people who are like you) or Standing Ovation (peer effect - acting like people you hang around with) 

- You can't (lol)
    - By just looking at least
    - You can only tell if you have dynamic data
        - Meaning more data over time
        - Continous data
