- traditional managers cannot short, while alternatives can
- alternative investment managers can use derivatives and leverage to hedge returns
- alternative manages may have specialized knowledge or unique access

**A. Notes**

- no technical definition of "hedge fund" or "private equity" ??? not homogenous groups
- hedge fund- a term used to describe an unregulated investment partnership setup by a money manager - and oddly enough, many of these funds do not engage in hedging
    - use leverage
    - long&short
    - many different assets
- private equity- an quity or debt investment in a firm that is not traded on a public exchange. It consists of investors and funds that make investments directly into private firms - which use the proceeds to fund new technologies, expand working capital, or to make acquisitions
- these offer an opportunity for greater diversification
- investors have to carry out their own due diligence on hedge funds/private equity firms
- these firms are also not liquid (not publicly traded), so it's difficult for an investor to get their money out of one
- types:
    - long-short equity funds
    - hedged or market neutral funds
    - global macro funds
- private equity is a pooled investment vehicle that is privately offered
- one type: venture capital
- "Mezzanine (or bridge) financing is a form of private equity investing employed by private companies before their IPO. The proceeds allow private firms to obtain the necessary funding for the maintenance of operations before going public."
- hedge funds and private equity do earn substantial excess returns, but there is wide variation
    - the best-performing funds are generally closed to new investors

        - reduced due diligence require
        - increased diversification
        - access to top funds
    - disadvantages
        - additional fees/cost
