COMPUTATIONAL INVESTING HOMEWORK
============
This is the set of homework I did for Computational Investing Part 1 (https://www.coursera.org/course/compinvesting1)

COURSERA'S COMPUTATIONAL INVESTING PART-1 COURSE
---------------
Why do the prices of some companies’ stocks seem to move up and down together while others move separately? What does portfolio “diversification” really mean and how important is it? What should the price of a stock be? How can we discover and exploit the relationships between equity prices automatically? We’ll examine these questions, and others, from a computational point of view. You will learn many of the principles and algorithms hedge funds and investment professionals use to maximize return and reduce risk in equity portfolios.
