<center> <h2>Using Python to Access Web Data - Week 4</h2> </center>
<center> <h3>---------------------------------------</h3> </center>

####*Video 3.1 - Networked Programs*

**A. Notes**

- browsers display web pages and run JavaScript
- servers are running stuff like PHP/MySQL

**B. Transport Control Protocol (TCP)**

- Built on top of IP (internet protocol)
- assumes IP might lose some data
    - stores and retransmits data if it seems to be lots
- handles "flow control" using a transmit window
- provides a nice reliable \textbf{pipe}
- response/request = cycle of transmitting data over the internet between computers
- the "transport" layer is like a "peer-to-peer" layer
- a scoekt is a connection like an "in progress" phone call

**C. Sockets**

- a \textbf{socket} an Internet socket or network socket is an endpoint of a bidirectional inter-process communication flow across an Internet Protocol-based computer network, such as the Internet."

**D. Port Numbers**

- a port is an application-specific or process-specific software communications endpoint
    - like extensions in a phone number
- client make requests, server responds
- the IP address is equivalent to the domain name address
- running on localhost
    - sometimes we see the port number in the URL if the web server is running on a "non-standard" port
    - for example, "http://localhost:8085/stuff.html"

**E. Sockets in Python**

- you might treat a socket like a file handle
- opening a socket = opening a "portal" to the data
- a "stream socket" means you get the data back in order
- applications are like what you say and expect to hear on the "phone calls" of sockets

####*Video 3.2 - From Sockets to Applications*

**A. Notes**

- since TCP (and Python) gives us a reliable socket, what do we do now?
- HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol
    - the dominant application layer protocol
    - invented for the Web, to retrieve HTML, images, docs,
    - extended to data APIs
- successful because it's simple
- in protocols "all that matters is that we agree"
- you have to decide who talks first

**B. More on HTTP**

- URL = "uniform resource locator"
- protocol, host, document structure

**C. Getting Data from the Server**

- request/response cycle
- each time you click something directing you to a new =href, you are in the cycle
- clicking on a link is a GET request
- the server returns the HTML document to the browser, which formats it
- standards developed by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
- the IP layer was invented in 1981

**D. Telnet**

- telnet is a command line tool sending keystrokes across the internet (over a socket)

**E. The Command Line**

- most hacking is done at the command line
- when you broswer is spinning, that means the site is running around doing lots of request/response cycles

####*Video 3.3 - Let's Write a Web Browser*

**A. Notes**

- around 12 lines of code with low-level ```socket```

**B. Urllib**

- ```urllib``` makes URLs act like files
- it's an "application layer" module for working with web data
- turns something very complex into something easy and usable
    - assumes you just want the data
    - "turns URLs into files"

####*Video 3.4 - BONUS: Leonard Kleinrock - The First Two Packets on the ARPANET*

**A. Notes**

- created for the purpose of sharing resources
- October 29, 1969, first packet transmitted over ARPANET
- Shannon - emergent properties of many many characters
- next move: distributed control

####*Video 3.5 - BONUS: Robert Cailliau - co-Inventor of the Web*

**A. Notes**

- "we have this need to move documents around"
- the first web server around 1990
- 1994 as "year of the web"
    - commerce begins on web
- Mosaic was "no good, but easy to install"
- "HTML is as bad as TeX"
- the Web was developed by Cailliau + TBL + 2 students
