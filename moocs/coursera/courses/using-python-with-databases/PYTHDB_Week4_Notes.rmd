####*Video 4.1 - Many to Many Relationships*

**A. Notes**

- all we've done so far has been one-to-many relationships
	- this is the most common type of relationship
- for many-to-many, we build a "connection" table in the middle that models the connections between keys
	- we decompose a many-to-many into two one-to-many relationships
- creating the connector table, an example:

```
CREATE TABLE User (
	id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
	name TEXT,
	email TEXT)
	
CREATE TABLE Course (
	id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
	title TEXT
)

CREATE TABLE Member (
	user_id INTEGER,
	course_id INTEGER,
	role INTEGER,
	PRIMARY KEY (user_id, course_id)
)
```

**B. Why Do This?**

- speed. period.
- speed begins to matter quickly in anything worth writing
- not a trade-off....either your thing is small enouogh that you don't need this, or it won't run at all withouot it
- there is no "Advanced SQl"...there's beginner, then the rest of your life

####*Video 4.2 - Many to Many Roster Demo*

**A. Notes**

- "junction table" for a many-to-many table
- no primary keys in the junction tables
- we're going to work through a real-life example of making a many-to-many table here
- ```executescript``` in Python lets you throw in multiple execute commands with semicolons
- you can use ```UNIQUE``` in a variable declaration to ensure
- in a junction table, you define a concatenated primary key like ```PRIMARY KEY (user_id, course_id)```
- ```json_data = json.loads(str_data)```
