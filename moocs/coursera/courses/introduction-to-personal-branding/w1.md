### Course objectives

I have established six main learning objectives for this course. 

Learners will: 

1) understand both what personal branding means and what it means to be a brand; 

2) establish themselves on at least three social media platforms; 

3) define a brand mission statement for their personal brand; 

4) build a board of directors for their brand; 

5) become familiar with the basics of digital security and reputation management; and 

6) create a routine for on-going brand maintenance.

### How personal should your brand be?

Hello, dear learners! 

MANY of you have tweeted, emailed, or posted in the forums to tell me that, for many different reasons, the idea of promoting yourself feels wrong/gross/arrogant, etc. I've decided that it is more efficient to post these two blog posts here, rather than trying to respond to you individually.

Yes, I wrote both of these. Is it arrogant of me to post them?? Perhaps :) Read them, and tell me what you think. If they change your mind on the subject, please let me know. If they don't change your mind, let me know that, too!

### Know Thyself

Myers Briggs Personality tests

Go to the[ ](http://psychcentral.com/quizzes/personality/start.php)[PsychCentral site, and take the MBTI test (free).](http://psychcentral.com/quizzes/personality/start.php)

While taking the test, you should neither rush through the questions, nor overthink them. You won't be judged for your result, rather, the point of this exercise is for you to better understand yourself. As Dostoyevsky wrote,

“Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others." 

So, please: answer the quiz questions honestly!

### Brand and Authenticity

#### Brand authenticity and Photo

One thing that I've noticed that helps me in any stressful situation is having a script. For instance, when I know that I'm going to be meeting a lot of new people, I establish a script in my mind, such as, "Hi, I'm Kimberley Barker, and I work at UVA. It's so nice to meet you." It may seem silly, but having the script to turn to helps focus me, and that settles my nerves. 

I've found that doing something similar when I'm being photographed helps: there are a few things that I've learned to do, and I can (mostly) count on muscle memory to kick in and help me out. Those things include straightening my back, pushing my shoulders down and back, lifting my chin, and tilting my head slightly. 

I've included links to some articles below, and they have really great tips which I hope will help! If you have some tips that you think would benefit the rest of the community (or simply want to commiserate about the awfulness of being photographed!), please post them in the comments.

#### Revisting your 3 words



### Mission Statement

As the old adage goes: "The ability to teach something to someone else is proof that you've mastered that thing". This holds true for mission statements as well, because a well-written mission statement (whether personal or professional) is proof that the person or organization has done the deeply introspective work necessary to distill their purposes and beliefs into two-three sentences- a person not familiar with a company (or individual) should be able to read the mission statement and know exactly what to expect.

The three articles below might be helpful to you as you begin crafting your mission statement. After completing it, be sure to post it on the forum so that the community can offer feedback!

## Establishing Board of Directors

### We've discussed the whys of needing a personal Board of Directors; these articles will provide direction for choosing the members. After choosing your four members, head over to the forum and tell us who you chose (no names, please), and why you chose them.

### [Five Rules For Selecting Your Personal Board Of Directors](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2014/07/16/five-rules-for-selecting-your-personal-board-of-directors/) ("Forbes")

 " Many of us have a small group of people that we reach out to whenever we make a major decision. This typically includes family members, friends, etc. For example, imagine that you are considering moving your family to another country. Who are the people you would talk to before making this decision?"

### [Five People You Need On Your Personal Board of Directors](http://theglasshammer.com/2011/07/15/five-people-you-need-on-your-personal-board-of-directors/)

"Almost as important as figuring out who you need is figuring out who you DON'T need on your board. There’s nothing wrong with stirring it up a little by choosing people whose personalities, life experiences, and professional backgrounds that are different than yours. Actually, that’s ideal."

### [Looking Out for Number One](http://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/looking-out.html)

"The personal board serves not only as a mechanism to preserve your core values but also as a way to stimulate self-renewal."
