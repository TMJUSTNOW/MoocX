## Lesson 1 - Start the Tests

### Introduction

Hi, I'm Toni Ratliff. This course is going to be fun. It takes a new spin on Myers-Briggs and other personality tests so you can increase your EQ. We're going to take you to the zoo, a zip line, and a ton of other places. 

How does a blonde baton twirler go from the football field to overseeing a large healthcare organization, the University of Florida Student Health Care Center? The answer is emotional intelligence. 

My success and yours involves academics, degrees, IQ, and other hard skills. But our success of getting into an organization, getting ahead, and rising above the rest also requires a lot of people skills. **EQ**, the soft skills, you'll gain these by taking this course. I like to say, hard skills may get you in the door but soft skills will keep you there. I know this because it's been my experience. 

Studies have shown that people with high EQ have greater mental health, job performance, and leadership skills. So, three personality tests with three different values. The Berg test, Myers-Briggs, and the Big Five. See, there's something for everyone, everywhere. 

### Toni Talks: Operationalizing Personality Types

My interest in personality types stated in the University of Florida College of Nursing when my class took the Myers Briggs personality test. Like most when learning their type, I thought I was the wrong type or chose the wrong profession. Because my type was completely different than my nursing classmates. Most of my classmates were female and most were feeling types, I was a thinking type. The thinking preference combined with my intuition preference rather than the sensing is very rare, I am an INTJ. Only 2% to 4% of the population has this type. And less than 1% of females are INTJs. 

So it didn't matter what profession I was in, I would be a minority. 

I mention this because we look for certain types in college majors and organizations. And although I've seen predominant types in different academic majors and organizations, there are always type variations. And that's the good news, don't feel as if you're the wrong type. 

Personality tests and learning about the types is a tool, it's not an exact science yet. 

As I'm matured in my understanding of INTJ's strengths and weaknesses, I was better able to steer my nursing duties and career to match. 

The INTJ combination points to a highly developed imagination and the ability to apply detail to visualization, that's bringing into being original and practical solutions. So, I'm not able to not only see the vision, I can build it. 

I've operationalized my INTJ abilities building visions to become a reality into my job interviews, building teams and working with entire organizations. During my job interview for the position that I have now, I knew what type I was, but I didn't know who'd be across the table from me interviewing me. So I spent time on the website of the organization trying to figure out the type of the person who would be my boss. I also looked at the written words and mission and vision of the organization. 

I went into the interview with a theory and after hearing him talk, I was pretty sure he was an ENFP. 

I needed to steer my answers, concepts and how I would add value if he hired me accordingly. 

This is how I operationalize personality types at the interview and beyond. 

He talked a lot more than he thought. I could see him thinking as he heard himself talk, so probably an extrovert NE. 

He talked about over arching goals and purpose, very future oriented, not focusing on the here and now or maintaining a current state. 

I thought he would be in an intuitive type as I am, since we are both very future oriented. 

He cared a lot about the people and how they felt about work. He used feeling words frequently. So it was easy for me to think he was an F, a feeling preference. 

He presented a vision of service but he had no thoughts on how to get there. He left things very open-ended. He didn't list specifics such as, I want this position to do one, two, three. From this information I decided he was probably a P, perceiving preference. In fact he made the comment, I have no idea how to get there, I only know I want to get there. That anthem tipped me off that he was a P, perceiving and that he was a visionary. I thought to myself, he is probably an ENFP and I am an INTJ. 

He asked me if I had any questions. I asked, what top three things over the next year to three years do you want this job to accomplish? He named them. I asked what his passion was, he said customer service. I said mine too. Then I took the ball and repeated the top three things he wanted me to accomplish. I let him know that my gifts and personality would make a great team with his gifts and personality by saying, you're a visionary, I'm a builder, I will build your vision. That's what I do. I told him it would be an honor to build it together, especially with our shared vision of customer service. 

I was hired and we built a very progressive, innovative, and effective and efficient organization. We were the first US health care organization, for example, that went totally electronic before it was mandated by the government by ten years. These are the strengths of an ENFP and an INTJ working together, the vision gets built. 

After being hired, I started building teams. I not only looked at the department someone worked in, but I looked at what they would bring to the table to make the team magic happen. For example, many are not title leaders but have an ability to work well with others. They may have great current knowledge sensing, and data analysis skills, thinking needed for a project. Some are feeling types that can help the team better understand the toll a process change may take on everyone. 

Each preference adds value. Knowing team dynamics, personality types, and how to take a team from various work areas to work well together is worth the work. 

Encouraging the introverts to share their ideas, and for extroverts to let the introverts share their ideas. And pointing out the value of adding a devil's advocate type to the team to irritate them and the new ideas instead tried and true ones is a powerful role you have when you build teams. 

From leading team, to several departments, to leading an entire team I use the same personality type preference that I help team leaders grow this skills. As one grows higher in the organization the leadership bench needs developing. One person can't nor should they do it all. Expanding ones knowledge of personality types by passing the info to others, is a necessary and smart thing to do. Sometimes, like people, organizations can become stale or complacent. We can mix things up by shifting types with other types. We can help individuals to better understand themselves, then others and then an entire organization. 

When meeting others, I listen to the words they use, and I watch their behaviors. Not to put them in a box, but to better understand how I can communicate in according to how they frame the world, instead of how I do. My message has a better chance of being understood. 

So take the personality test, look into who you are, who others are, have fun with it, and learn to put knowledge of personality types into action. 

Welcome! Let's "hit it hard and hit it fast" by jumping right into the 3 tests!

**Step 2**- Use the internet to search for your type.

### Overview of 3 Tests

Did your type surprise you? If so, does sharing your type with others help? I've found that when people learn about their type initially, they feel like it's a bad type, the wrong type, they wish they were another type. They feel like the preferences box them in, limit them, but as Einstein said, once you accept your limits, you can go beyond. So, get over your defensiveness, taking it personal, feeling vulnerable and be the best self that you can be. 

So, what's the value, again? As Aristotle said, knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom. So know yourself, and understand others. Once you understand how others frame the world, you're more likely to be understood. 

And communicating effectively increases trust, increases speed with which things can be accomplished, and increases the rate at which your goals can be achieved. So, I like to say together we're better living an authentic life. That's what it's all about, that's where the magic happens. So, first, know yourself, second, know others, and then live at the highest level where you can reach out, rise above the rest with everyone in an organization. 

Companies agree, personality tests add value. Currently, 62% of all HR departments use personality tests to assess new hires. This is up from 50% since 2010. 

#### MBTI

Knowing your type will help you get in, get ahead, and rise above the rest. But before we begin, let me take you back to where it all began. Back to Carl Jung, the father of modern psychology, archetypes, universalism, and collective consciousness. 

What Carl Jung began, the mother-daughter team Myers-Briggs finished. They helped to bridge the gap between academic research language to modern day language. Of all the tests, Myers-Briggs is my favorite. 

The original documents are here in the Rare Book Room. Myers-Briggs has 16 types and four preferences. It's the most popular and the most utilized in corporations today. 

#### Bird Test

Another test that you might want to use is the bird test. It's easy, simple, and fun. There's four birds, a dove, an owl, a peacock, and an eagle. This test is one that you can easily use to build a team. 

#### The Big Five

The big five, for those of you interested in academic research, this is a test for you. It has five factors. It's more complex, but for those who want to contribute to generalized knowledge, this is the test for you. 

See, there's something for everyone. The Big Five, Myers-Briggs, and the bird test. Over the next few weeks, I'm going to teach you how to operationalize personality preferences, so that you can get in, get ahead and rise above the rest.

### Carl Jung and Archetypes

Let's take a few minutes to talk about Carl Jung. Jung was one of the grandfathers of modern psychology. 


Here's a clip of Sigmund Freud meeting with Carl Jung. 

> Well I just paid a visit to him in Vietnam and then we talked for 13 hours without interruption. >> 13 hours without interruption? >> 13 hours without interruption. 

We didn't realize that we were almost dead at the end of it but it was tremendously interesting. He was the old man and after great experience and he was of course way ahead of me and so I settled down to learn something. >> Jung was borne in Switzerland in 1875 but his work impacts us on so many levels today, via psychology, literature, religion and many more. 

As I mentioned in my previous lecture, Jung's theories on personality and archetypes laid the foundation for the work of Myers Briggs and modern personality testing. Myers Briggs took the next leap to further categorize these types into more concrete examples. 

One of the central tenants of Jung's theory was that direct observation of personality was difficult if not impossible. Instead he suggested that we should look at indirect imitations of human personality through our dreams, myths and religions. Jung stopped short of making clear categories of personality. 

Instead, he opted for more general archetypal figures like the mother, father and trickster. 

Let's use the trickster figure as an example. This figure can be seen throughout many cultures in the world from Africa to Native Americans to the very early Europeans. This is an image of Heyoka, the Lakota sacred clown drawn by Black Hawk. 

The Norse god Loki is a name that is familiar to many of us and is a modern example of this trickster figure. Here we see a historic depiction from the 1700s juxtaposed with the modern day interpretation. We will explore this relationship between superheros and personality a bit later. 

But for our next few lectures, we will look at the modern interpretation of Carl Jung's ideas, personality test. 

### Myers-Briggs
Now we're going to discuss the three tests in depth. And we're going to start with my favorite, Myers-Briggs. It is the Holy Grail. If you remember, it's the oldest and time-tested test as well. It's used in academia, government, research. It's the most popular test. It was started by Carl Jung, the father of modern psychology, but it was perfected by the mother-daughter Team, Myers-Briggs. Myers-Briggs is broken down into 16 types, and within the 16 types are four preferences. The E and the I, the N and the S, the F and the T, and the J and the P. 

These four preferences can be easily identified by listening to the words people use. How they process information, how they recharge their batteries, how they make decisions, and how they organize life. These preferences aren't meant to box you in, but just help you understand your preferences of behavior so that you can understand first yourself, then who's across the table, on your team, and in the organization, so that you can get in, get ahead, and rise above the rest. 

## Lesson 3 - You and your Superhero

Now, let's make the connection between you and your superhero!

### Is Vader valuable? (Guy Nicolette, MD; Assistant Professor and Director of PCSMFP)


[MUSIC] Although my personality type isn't the same as Lord Vader's, his adds much value to mine. You see, he's an ESTJ and I'm an INTP. And together, we lead more effectively because of our complimentary approaches. He's an extrovert and is pretty judge-y and I prefer introversion and perceiving. 

While ESTJs are natural leaders, take charge easily, and enforce the rules, my type, the INTP prefers to be a solo performer and allow others to self-regulate. F or feeling is not a part of either of our natural preferences. So I need to make sure that I have feelers on the executive team to help me lead. Setting and achieving organizational goals is my job. But doing so without killing everyone is pretty important. 

So in this case, Captain America could really be Darth's ally because feelers help thinkers round off their heart edges. 

Together we're better, as a more complete team, rising above the rest [MUSIC]
