# [Software Engineering for SaaS] (https://www.coursera.org/saas/class)

=================================

## Introduction


### Independent Products vs Continous Improvement

- Hardware 
    - Cost of field upgrade is a lot
    - Bugs = return HW
- Software
    - Cost of field upgrade is almost 0
    - Bugs - wait for upgrade
- HW decays, SW long lasting

### Legacy Software vs Beautiful Software

- Legacy
    - Old SW that continues to meet customers needs, but difficult to evolve over time
- Beautiful
    - Meets customers needs and easy to evolve

### Quiz

**Which type of SW is considered an epic failure**

- (a) Beautiful Code
- (b) Legacy Code
- (c) Unexpectedly short-lived code
- (d) Legacy and short-lived code

**Answer:** (c)


## Waterfall vs. Agile (Development Processes)

- **Waterfall**
    - "Big Design Up Front" or BDUF
    - Requirements analysis and specification
    - Architectural Design
    - Implementation and integration
    - Verification
    - Operation and Maintenance
    - Complete one phase before starting next one
    - Works well for important software witch specs that won't change (NASA, aircraft control)
- **Agile**
    - Developers continuously refine working but incomplete prototype until customers are happy with feedback
    - Agile emphasizes *Test-Driven Development* to reduce mistakes
    - User Stories

### Quiz

**What is not a key difference between waterfall and agile lifecycles**

- (a) Waterfall uses long sequential phases, Agile uses quick iterations
- (b) Waterfall has no working code until the end, Agile has working code each iteration
- (c) Waterfall uses unchanging written requirements, Agile doesn't
- (d) Waterfall has an architectural design phase, but Agile ignores software architecture

**Answer:** (c)

## Assurance 

- **Verification**
    - Did you build the thing right?
- **Validation**
    - Did you build the right thing?

- Hardware focuses generally on Verification
- Software focuses generally on Validation

### Testing

- Exhaustive testing is infeasible
- You therefore divide and conquer: perform different tests at different phases of SW development

**Unit Test**

Single method that does what was expected

**Module or Functional Test**

A test accross individual units

**Integration Test**

Interfaces between units, has consistent assumptions and communicates correctly

**System or Acceptance Test**

Integrated program meets its specifications

**Coverage**  

% of code paths tests

**Regression Testing** 

Automatically rerun old tests so changes don't break what used to work

**Continous Integration Testing**

Continous regression testing vs. later phases

#### Agile

Write tests *before* you write code you wish you had


### Formal Methods

Start with formal specifications and proce program behaviour follows specs

- Human does proof
- Computer proves it via automatic theorem proving
    - Uses references and logical axioms to produce proofs from scratch
- Computer via model checking

- Computationally expensive
    - Small, fixed function
    - Expensive to repair, very hard to test

### Quiz

**Which of the following statements is not true about testing?**

- (a) With better test coverage, you are more likely to catch faults
- (b) While difficult to achieve, 100% test coverage insures design reliability
- (c) Each higher level delegates more detailed testing to lower levels
- (d) Unit testing works within a single class and module/functional testing works across classes

**Answer:** (b)

## Productivity

### Moore's Law

- HW designs get bigger
- SW designs get bigger
- Must improve HW and SW

**Solving techniques**

- Clarity via conciseness
- Synthesis
- Reuse
- Automation and tools

### Clarity cia consiseness

**Syntax**

- Shorter and easier to read
- Raise the level of abstraction
    - High Level Programming vs assembly lang
    - Automatic memory management (Java vs. C)
    - Scripting languages: reflection, metaprogramming

### Synthesis

- BitBlt: generate code to fit situation and remove conditional tests
- Future Research: Programming by example

### Reuse

- Reuse code vs rewriting new code
- Techniques in historical order
- Have standardized libraries
- OOP
- Design Patters: reuse of general strategy evenif implementation varies

### Automation and Tools

- Replace tedious manual tasks with automation
- UI quality, unreliability (-ves)
- We think good software developer must repeatedly learn how to use new tools

### Quiz

**Which of the following is true about productivity**

- (a) Copy and pasting code is another good way to get reuse
- (b) Reflection helps productivity via program synthesis
- (c) The strongest of the 4 productivity reasons for useing HLL is reuse
- (d) A concise syntax is more likely to have fewer bugs and be easier to maintain

**Answer:** (d)

### DRY

**Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**

- Don't copy and paste code


## Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS delivers SW and data as a service over the internet

**6 Reasons for Saas**

1. No install worries about HW compatibility, OS
2. No worries about data loss
3. Easy for grouyps to interact with same data
4. If data is large or changed frequently, simpler to keep 1 copy at central site
5. 1 copy of SW, controlled HW environment
6. 1 copy simplifies upgrades for developers

### Quiz

**Which is the weakest argument for Google apps` popularity as Saas**

- (a) Don't lose data: Gmail
- (b) Cooperating group: Documents
- (c) Large dataset : YouTube
- (d) No field upgrade when improving app : Search

**Answer:** (d)

## Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)

An architecture where all components are designed to be services

Apps composes of interoperable services:

- Easy to tailor new version for subset of users
- Also easier to recover from mistake in design

In a SOA

- Internal subsystems can share data directly
- Can recombile to make a new service

### Quiz

**Which statement(s) are not true about SOA?**

- (a) Debugging is easier with SOA
- (b) Security can be harder with SOA
- (c) SOA improves developer productivity primarily through reuse
- (d) No service can name or access another service's data; it can only make requests for data through an external API

**Answer:** (a) and (b)

## Cloud Computing

### Saas Infrastructure

- Saas demands on infrastructure
- Scalability
- Dependability - 24X7

### Clusters

Commodity computers connected by commodity Ethernet switches

- More scalable than conventional servers
- Much cheaper than conventional services (~20 times)
- Few operations for 1000s servers (VMs)
- Dependability via extensive redundancy

### Public Cloud Computing

- Offers computing, storage, communication at pennies per hour
- No premium to scale
    - 1000 computers @ 1 hour
    - ==
    - 1 computer @ 1000 hours
- Illusion of infinite scalability to cloud user
    - As many computers as you can afford

### Quiz

**Which statements are not true about SaaS, SOA and Cloud Computing**

- (a) Clusters are collections of commodity servers connected by LAN switches
- (b) The internet supplies the communication for SaaS
- (c) Cloud computing uses HW clusters and SW layer using redundancy for dependability
- (d) Private datacenters could match cost of warehouse-scale computers if they just purchased the same type of hardware

**Answer:** (d)

### Fallacies and Pitfalls

**Fallacy** 

If a software project is falling behind schedule, catch up by adding people

- Adding people makes it worse
- Time for new people
- Communication increases as project grows

**Pitfalls**

Ignoring the cost of software design

- Since ~0 cost to manufacture software, might believe ~0 cost to remanucature they way the customer wants
- Ignores teh cost of design and test
