# Computational Neuroscience

## 1.2 Descriptive Models

### What is computational neuroscience

- The goal is to explain 'how brain generates behaviours'
- Its the field that helps us:
  - Categorize what nervous system does
  - How they function
  - Why they operate in partiuclar ways


**Question**

**This describes a model of a specific neuron in a cat responding to visual stimuli. Which of the following functions most accurately depict the model we are talking about here?**

**Answer:** Frequency of spikes = f(Light bar's orientation)

### Receptive fields

Specific properties of a sensory stimulus that generates a strong response from a cell

Examples: Spot of light that turns on at a particular location

**Descriptive model of Receptive fields**

- Retina conveys the image to Lateral Ganglion Cells
- You can try to flash light at different location on the retina
  - You may find that the cell will only response when you turn on the light
  - When you turn light on surrounding area, the cells may stop responding
- This is referred to as Center-surround receptive fields in the retina
   - On-Center / Off-Surrounding Receptive field
   - Off-Center / On-Surrounding Receptive field
- Info from the retina now passes to the primary visual cortex of the brain
- We can quantify these fields via reverse correlation
- At the cortex, we get orientid receotuve fields

**Question**

**The On-Center/Off-Surround Receptive field can be thought of as a filter. This filter results in more activation due to certain stimuli and a depression in activation due to other stimuli. What is this particular thing doing?**

**Answer:** Causing activation with stimuli concentrated on the center of the visual field, and depressing activation with stimuli which are concentrated in the surround


## 1.3 Mechanistic and Interpretive Models

**Mechanisic model of Receptive fields**

- How are receptive fields constructed using the neural circuitry of the visual cortex
- How do you obtain oriented receptive fields from center-surrounded receptive fields
- Info flows from optic nerve to LGN (Lateral Geniculate Nucleus) to V1 (Primary Visual Cortex)
- LGN cells converge to a single V1 cell
- Center-surrounded LGN RFs are displaced akibg preffered orientation of V1 cells (still controversial)


**Question**

**This is an example of a mechanistic model. By mechanistic we mean:**

**Answer:** The model describes how the neural system does what we have observed it to do


**Interpretive model of Receptive fields**

- Why are receptive fields in V1 shaped in this way?
- What are the compuational advantages of such receptive fields

**Effecient coding hypothesis**

- The goal of the brain through evolution is to represent images as faithfully and effecient as possible using neurons with RF RF_1 and RF_2, etc

- Given image I we can reconstruct I using neural response r_1, r_2,..

```tex
\hat{I} = \sum\limits_{i} RF_i \times r_i 
```

- Idea: What are the RF_i that minimize the total squared pixelwise errors between I and I^hat and are as independent as possible


**Question**

**When we say linear combination, we are talking abuot a specific mathematical way of combining several things together. Which of the following looks most like an example of a linear combination of receptive fields to form an image reconstruction, assuming I is the image and RFs are the receptive fields we are combining**

**Answer:** I = 3*RF_1 + 2*RF_2 + 5*RF_3

- Start out with random RF_1 and run your effecient coding algo to minimize the reconstruction err on natural image patches

Coding algorithms

- Sparse coding
- ICA
- Predictive coding


**Question**

**With this interpretive model of V1 receptive fields, our purpose is to:**

**Answer:** Give an explanation why V1 RF are formed the way they are, demonstate the perceptual process in the brain may be formed in a way that allows for a faithful and efficient encoding of the natural env and provide a computational model of one aspect of the brains organization, which gives us insights that may be difficult to derive from strict emprical measurements alone
