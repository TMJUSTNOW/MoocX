# Assessing Your Negotiating Style*

To assess your negotiation style while preparing for negotiations, complete the following three steps:

1. Complete the attachment to assess and understand your negotiating style.
2. Use the assessment to assess the style of the other side. This is especially important in cross-cultural negotiations. Remember that there can be considerable variation in negotiation style within a culture.
3. Do a gap analysis. Locate the major gaps between your style and the style of the other side. Focus on these gaps when preparing for the negotiation.

*Additional tip*: After completing the gap analysis, try a role reversal exercise where you use the style of the other side. This will enable you to better understand the other side’s style.

\-----------------------

## Assessing Your Negotiating Style

Instructions: Listed below are ten important traits of a person’s negotiating style and approach. Each trait demonstrates a wide range of variations, which can be organized along a continuum, as has been done below. With respect to each trait, indicate

with an X where your own negotiating style and approach in business negotiation falls along each continuum.

1. *Goal*: What is your goal in business negotiations: a binding contract or the creation of a relationship?

2. *Attitudes*: What is your attitude toward negotiation: win/lose or win/win?

![img](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/flex-successfulnegotiation/attitudes.png)

3. *Personal Styles*: During negotiations, is your personal style informal or formal?

![img](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/flex-successfulnegotiation/personal%20styles.png)

4. *Communications*: Is your communication style in negotiation direct (for instance, clear and definite proposals and answers) or indirect (for instance, vague, evasive answers)?

![img](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/flex-successfulnegotiation/communications.png)

5. *Time Sensitivity*: In the negotiation process, is your sensitivity to time high (for instance, you want to make a deal quickly) or low (you negotiate slowly)?

![img](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/flex-successfulnegotiation/high%3Alow.png)

6. *Emotionalism*: During negotiations, is your emotionalism high (that is, you have a tendency to display your emotions) or low (you hide your feelings)?

![img](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/flex-successfulnegotiation/high%3Alow.png)

7. *Agreement Form*: Do you prefer agreements that are specific (that is, detailed) or general?

![img](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/flex-successfulnegotiation/agreement%20form.png)

8.*Agreement Building*: Do you view negotiation as bottom up (reach agreement on details first) or top down (begin with agreement on general principle)?

![img](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/flex-successfulnegotiation/agreement%20building.png)

9. *Team Organization*: As a member of a negotiating team, do you prefer having one leader who has authority to make a decision or decision making by consensus?

![img](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/flex-successfulnegotiation/team%20organization.png)

10. *Risk Taking*: Is your tendency to take risks during negotiations high (for instance, your opening offer to sell is extremely high) or low?

# Checklist of Ethical Standards and Guidelines

Perhaps more than any other human activity, negotiations raise challenging ethical dilemmas. Some ethical standards are required by law; others are voluntary. Select one or more of the voluntary standards or guidelines before you begin a negotiation.

For further information and examples, see Chapter 4, “Decide How to Answer Ethical Questions,” in **Negotiating for Success**:

[http://www.amazon.com/Negotiating-Success-Essential-Strategies-Skills/dp/0990367193/ref=sr_1_1?s=boo...](http://www.amazon.com/Negotiating-Success-Essential-Strategies-Skills/dp/0990367193/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1413129983&sr=1-1&keywords=george+siedel).

## Required by Law:

1. **No Fraud.** (Do not lie.)
2. **Uphold your fiduciary duty.** (If there is a fiduciary relationship with the other side, you owe the highest duty of trust and loyalty.)
3. **Don’t act in an unconscionable manner.** (When you are in a dominant position of power, try to reach an agreement that is fair to the other side.)

## Voluntary Ethical Standards and Guidelines:

1. **Organizational standards.** (If your employer has a Code of Conduct, does it provide standards for your negotiations?)
2. **Someone you admire.** (What would someone you admire do in your situation?)
3. **Family test.** (How would you feel when describing to your family what you did during a negotiation?)
4. **Newspaper test.** (How would you feel if a newspaper article in the local paper described what you did during a negotiation?)
5. **Golden Rule.** (Treat others as you want to be treated. Keep in mind that fairness is very important to the other side.)
