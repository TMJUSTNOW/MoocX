## 2. Prepare: Plan Your Negotiation Strategy

This module focuses on *the first step in the negotiation process—planning for a negotiation*. After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Decide if a negotiation is position-based or interest-based
- Decide if a negotiation is dispute-resolution or deal-making
- Complete a negotiation analysis, including: setting a reservation price and stretch goal, identifying alternatives to a deal, and finding the zone of potential agreement
- Use a decision tree to determine your BATNA
- Conduct cross-cultural negotiations
- Resolve ethical issues in negotiations
- Decide if you should use an agent in a negotiation

### 2.1 Assessing Your Negotiating Style

To assess your negotiation style while preparing for negotiations, complete the following three steps:

> 

- Complete the attachment to assess and understand your negotiating style.
- Use the assessment to assess the style of the other side. This is especially important in cross-cultural negotiations. Remember that there can be considerable variation in negotiation style within a culture.
- Do a gap analysis. Locate the major gaps between your style and the style of the other side. Focus on these gaps when preparing for the negotiation.

Additional tip: After completing the gap analysis, try a role reversal exercise where you use the style of the other side. This will enable you to better understand the other side’s style.

- `Assessing Your Negotiating Style`

Instructions: Listed below are ten important traits of a person’s negotiating style and approach. Each trait demonstrates a wide range of variations, which can be organized along a continuum, as has been done below. With respect to each trait, indicate with an X where your own negotiating style and approach in business negotiation falls along each continuum.

- Goal: What is your goal in business negotiations: a binding contract or the creation of a relationship?

- Attitudes: What is your attitude toward negotiation: win/lose or win/win?

[![img](./images/687474703a2f2f6c6974616f74616f2e6769746875622e696f2f696d616765732f636f6d6d756e69636174696f6e732e706e67.png)

- Time Sensitivity: In the negotiation process, is your sensitivity to time high (for instance, you want to make a deal quickly) or low (you negotiate slowly)?

[![img](./images/687474703a2f2f6c6974616f74616f2e6769746875622e696f2f696d616765732f686967682533416c6f772e706e67.png)

- Emotionalism: During negotiations, is your emotionalism high (that is, you have a tendency to display your emotions) or low (you hide your feelings)?

[![img](./images/687474703a2f2f6c6974616f74616f2e6769746875622e696f2f696d616765732f686967682533416c6f772e706e67.png)

- Agreement Form: Do you prefer agreements that are specific (that is, detailed) or general?

[![img](./images/687474703a2f2f6c6974616f74616f2e6769746875622e696f2f696d616765732f61677265656d656e74253230666f726d2e706e67.png)

- Agreement Building: Do you view negotiation as bottom up (reach agreement on details first) or top down (begin with agreement on general principle)?

[![img](./images/687474703a2f2f6c6974616f74616f2e6769746875622e696f2f696d616765732f61677265656d656e742532306275696c64696e672e706e67.png)

- Team Organization: As a member of a negotiating team, do you prefer having one leader who has authority to make a decision or decision making by consensus?

[![img](./images/687474703a2f2f6c6974616f74616f2e6769746875622e696f2f696d616765732f7465616d2532306f7267616e697a6174696f6e2e706e67.png)

- Risk Taking: Is your tendency to take risks during negotiations high (for instance, your opening offer to sell is extremely high) or low?

[![img](./images/687474703a2f2f6c6974616f74616f2e6769746875622e696f2f696d616765732f686967682533416c6f772e706e67.png)

## Checklist of Ethical Standards and Guidelines

Perhaps more than any other human activity, negotiations raise challenging ethical dilemmas. Some ethical standards are required by law; others are voluntary. Select one or more of the voluntary standards or guidelines before you begin a negotiation.

For further information and examples, see Chapter 4, “Decide How to Answer Ethical Questions,” in **Negotiating for Success**:

[http://www.amazon.com/Negotiating-Success-Essential-Strategies-Skills/dp/0990367193/ref=sr_1_1?s=boo...](http://www.amazon.com/Negotiating-Success-Essential-Strategies-Skills/dp/0990367193/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1413129983&sr=1-1&keywords=george+siedel).

[http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/483669](http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/483669)

### Required by Law:

1. **No Fraud.** (Do not lie.)
2. **Uphold your fiduciary duty.** (If there is a fiduciary relationship with the other side, you owe the highest duty of trust and loyalty.)
3. **Don’t act in an unconscionable manner.** (When you are in a dominant position of power, try to reach an agreement that is fair to the other side.)

### Voluntary Ethical Standards and Guidelines:

1. **Organizational standards.** (If your employer has a Code of Conduct, does it provide standards for your negotiations?)
2. **Someone you admire.** (What would someone you admire do in your situation?)
3. **Family test.** (How would you feel when describing to your family what you did during a negotiation?)
4. **Newspaper test.** (How would you feel if a newspaper article in the local paper described what you did during a negotiation?)
5. **Golden Rule.** (Treat others as you want to be treated. Keep in mind that fairness is very important to the other side.)
