Your browser can now "manage" the base agent and its MBeans. The HTML
protocol adaptor outputs HTML pages that represent the agent and
its MBeans. The adaptor interacts with the <I>MBean server</I>, which is the
heart of the JMX agent, in order to get information about the MBeans
that it has registered. The adaptor also interprets the commands sent
back by the buttons and fields appearing in your browser.<P>

The first page displayed by the HTML adaptor is always the agent
view. It originally contains a list of all registered MBeans. In this
base agent, there are two MBeans, one of which is the HTML
adaptor. The MBean server delegate is not covered in this tutorial: see the JMX
specification document for more information.<P>

The text field for filtering lets you modify the list of displayed
MBeans. The filter string is initially <CODE>*:*</CODE>, which means
all registered MBeans. Futher use of the filter is covered in <A
HREF="filtering.html">Filtering the MBean List</A>. The agent's
registered domain tells you the name of the default domain in this
agent. In this case it is <I>DefaultDomain</I>: all MBeans created
without a domain will be given this domain name. The number of MBeans
on this page is just the number listed beneath the separator line.<P>

The "Admin" button is a link to the agent administration page; see <A
HREF="administration.html">Agent Administration topic</A> for more
information.<P>

The MBean list contains all MBeans whose object name matches the
filter string. Object names are unique for each MBean and consist of a
domain name and list of key-value pairs (these are further covered in
the <A HREF="administration.html#ObjectNames">Agent Administration
topic</A>). In this list, MBeans are sorted and grouped by their
domain name. Each MBean name listed is an active link to the MBean
view page for the corresponding object.<P>

In the base agent you have just launched, the only MBeans are the
functional components of the agent. In a real management solution, you
would also have an MBean for each resource you want to manage through
the agent. In such a case, you would create and register all the
resource MBeans required during the initialization of your agent
application.<P>

After its initialization, the contents of a JMX agent are dynamic: new
MBeans can be created and registered into new or existing domains and
old MBeans can be removed. These changes can also affect the
functionality of the agent: new agent services can be registered (or
removed) as well. We will demonstrate examples of such dynamic
management in this tutorial.<P>
