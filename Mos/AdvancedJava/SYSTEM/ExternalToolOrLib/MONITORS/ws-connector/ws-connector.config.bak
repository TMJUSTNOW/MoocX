3.	java -jar jsr262-ri.jar (location="https://ws-jmx-connector.dev.java.net/")

	jax-ws-latest-wsit/lib/webservices-rt.jar
6.	copy jax-ws-latest-wsit/lib/webservices-api.jar to <java-home>\lib\endorsed\
	Here <java-home> refers to the directory where the runtime software is installed (which is the top-level directory of the J2SE Runtime Environment or the jre directory in the JDK).
	
	The J2SE runtime environment will use classes in such JAR files to override the corresponding classes provided in the Java platform as shipped by Sun.
