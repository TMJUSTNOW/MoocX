JSR 262 Early Access 2 (May 2007) Release notes
================================================

JSR 262 Early Draft 2 Reference Implementation (RI). This RI is based on the
Web Services (WS) Management protocol. WS-Management is a Distributed Management 
Task Force (DMTF) standard. The specification available on the DMTF web site at 
http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wsman.

The JSR 262 RI project is a Java.net project available at the following web  
site: http://ws-jmx-connector.dev.java.net.

Dependencies
============
- JAX-WS 2.1.1 is required. You can download JAX-WS 2.1.1 from 
http://jax-ws.dev.java.net.
For more information on how to install and set up JAX-WS, please read the 
index.html file located in the samples directory after you install JSR 262.
- Wiseman, an open Source Java implementation of WS-Management 
(http://wiseman.dev.java.net) is bundled with this RI.
You do not need to download or install Wiseman. The Wiseman core classes are 
present in wiseman-core.jar (wiseman CVS tag pre-rc1-for-jsr262-ea2-26-04-2007, 
build ID 200704261526). 

Wiseman is licensed under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0. A copy 
of this license is present in the ThirdPartyLicense.txt file.

Interoperability
================
Although this RI is a compliant JMX Connector, it can be accessed from native 
WS-Management clients.
Interoperability has been tested with :
- Windows Vista winRM (Command line and API)
- Wiseman 0.6 clients (Java API for WS-Man, wiseman.dev.java.net)


Known Limitations / Issues
===========================
- JMX Connection Notifications are not supported. Connection IDs do not follow 
the JSR 160 specification.

- RI performance has not been a priority for this Early Access 2 release. The 
next release will address performance.

- Security limitations
    + No Subject delegation. The defined protocol does not convey an identity.
      The single identity is the one located in an HTTP header (Basic            
      authentication).
    + SSLSocketFactory cannot be passed to an HTTP transport. SSL is enabled by 
      setting SSL-specific System properties. An RFE has been logged against     
      JAX-WS to be able to plug in an SSLContext.
    + If a java.policy file is used, entries defined specifying a codeBase entry are ignored.


- QueryExp
    + There is currently no support whatsoever for custom QueryExp               
      implementations.
      A later release should come up with a solution to handle custom QueryExp   
      implementations.

- Exceptions
    + This is not a limitation but a change of behavior. On the client 
      side, when an exception is re-constructed, if the Exception class is
      not found, an IOException is constructed. RMI would have failed with a 
      ClassNotFoundException.
  
- Unsupported MBeanServerConnection operation
    - removeNotificationListener(ObjectName, ObjectName, Filter, Handback) is not 
      supported. To remove your listeners, use removeNotificationListener(ObjectName, ObjectName).


Tested Platforms
================
Java:
    * Java SE 5.0 Update 12
    * Java SE 6 Update 1

Operating systems
    * Solaris 10 Update 2
    * Windows XP Pro Service Pack 2
    * RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 Update 2

Hardware:
    * x86 (Intel Xeon & Pentium 4)
    * x64 (AMD Opteron)
    * Sparc


Differences with the EA 2 Specification
========================================

- Subscription without providing a Selector will result in subscription to all 
MBeans that are Notification Emitters. This will be specified in the next 
release of the specification.
