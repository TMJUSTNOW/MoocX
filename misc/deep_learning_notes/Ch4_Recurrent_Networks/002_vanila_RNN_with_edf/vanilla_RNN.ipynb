    "## Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network Implemented with `edf`\n",
    "\n",
    "- I want to implement a vanilla recurrent net before an LSTM\n",
    "- Back-Propagation Through Time (BPTT) is implemented with `edf`, the teaching framework from Toyota Technology Institute (Chiago). I decided not to implement the backward gradient by hand because it is prone to error. The tensor-flow auto-differentiation from `edf` was just the right amount of work, and debugging the tensor-flow was an effective learning experience. \n",
