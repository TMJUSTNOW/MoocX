    "## Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network Implemented with `edf`\n",
    "\n",
    "- I want to implement a vanilla recurrent net before an LSTM\n",
    "- Back-Propagation Through Time (BPTT) is implemented with `edf`, the teaching framework from Toyota Technology Institute (Chiago). I decided not to implement the backward gradient by hand because it is prone to error. The tensor-flow auto-differentiation from `edf` was just the right amount of work, and debugging the tensor-flow was an effective learning experience. \n",
    "- The Recurrent network learns from [Shakespear's Coriolanus](./input.txt). \n",
    "\n",
    "This code here is abstracted out from the [original notebook](vanilla_RNN.ipynb) as a Vanilla_RNN class with a `chain` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "rnn = Vanilla_RNN(Wxh, bh, Why, by)\n",
    "\n",
    "h[t+1], y[t] = rnn.chain(h[t], x[t])\n",
    "\n",
    "loss = loss + Dot@{Softmax(y[t]), labels[t]}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the LSTM notebook, we use swap out the rnn class and use the LSTM cell instead."
